/* ── THE DETAIL-PAGE CHOICE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-24: *"attach design 1 or design 2 as per the choice in the settings, in the header record — so we
 * avoid complication of moving from one record type to another and both can be tested independently."* And on
 * everything raised before it shipped: *"just to cover the existing chit, if nothing found, keep it as design 1."*
 *
 * ⭐⭐ TWO CLAIMS, TESTED WHERE EACH ONE LIVES:
 *
 *   THE RECORD  — a chit is stamped at creation and the stamp never moves. That is a fact about stored data, so
 *                 it is read back from the API. A UI check could not tell a stamp from a lucky render.
 *   THE SCREEN  — a stamped chit opens line by line. That is a fact about rendering, so it is read off the page.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND NOT BY SUBJECT. `composeChit` types a subject that a fresh entity's blueprint does not carry, so the
 * chit is created with an AUTO subject ("Order from e2eco-… — 25 Aug 2026") and every search for the typed one
 * fails forty seconds later as "not in the task list" — which reads like a broken list and is not. The send
 * response carries the chit_id; that is what this follows.
