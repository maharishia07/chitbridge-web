/**
 * panel-reachable.cjs — A PANEL CAN ALWAYS BE CLOSED, WHATEVER SIZE IT WAS LEFT AT.
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️⚠️ THE TRAP ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-12, with the Test lab filling more than his screen: *"current window is bigger than my screen,
 * i couldn't move left side as the movement is only on the right side, now i couldn't close the window or
 * reduce the size? what is this?"*
 *
 * `makeMovable` clamped the panel's POSITION into the viewport and never its SIZE. A panel sized on a wide
 * screen — or grown by `fit` — comes back wider than the window; `innerWidth - width` goes negative, the left
 * edge pins to 0, and every control in the header's right-hand group goes off-screen: close, size, refresh, all
 * of them. The panel is then unusable AND unclosable.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE SHAPE OF THE BUG IS WORTH MORE THAN THE FIX: the escape hatch was inside the thing that broke. Any
 * control that recovers a bad state must not itself depend on that state being good. The only way out was
 * clearing localStorage from a browser console, which is not a thing to ask of anybody.
 *
 * ⚠️ Static, because the real proof needs a browser at two window sizes — that belongs in a Playwright spec and
 * is worth writing. This guards the three lines whose absence brings the trap straight back.
 *
 * Run: node e2e/panel-reachable.cjs
