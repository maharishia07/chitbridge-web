/**
 * render-smoke.spec.js — DOES THE PAGE STILL RENDER? Run this BEFORE pushing anything that touches
 * app.html, shop.html or app/*.js.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Athi, 2026-08-09, after the cart integration: *"i should have fixed the cart first, then should have built all,
 * as it is the basic element."*
 *
 * Five defects came out of that integration, three of them introduced while fixing the previous one, two of which
 * took the PUBLIC STOREFRONT down:
 *
 *   1 · _shopSym deleted but still called            → ReferenceError, blank shop
 *   2 · prices silently regrouped 3400 → 3,400        → changed a public page's money format
 *   3 · a published data-testid renamed              → specs found nothing
 *   4 · the fix patched a call site nobody used      → grep said "fixed", the DOM said otherwise
 *   5 · the fix referenced init()'s local from the   → ReferenceError, blank shop AGAIN
 *       compat adapter
 *
 * Every one is legal JavaScript. `node -c` passed. The unit tests passed. check-app-parses passed. All five were
 * only observable when a browser actually ran the page — and each time I substituted a cheaper signal for that,
 * because the real check took four minutes and needed a deploy.
 *
 * THIS is the missing gate: seconds, no deploy, no login. It does not test features — variants.spec.js and the
 * module specs do that. It answers one question the cheap checks structurally cannot:
 *
 *      Did the page boot, and did it boot WITHOUT throwing?
 *
 * ── HOW TO RUN IT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *      npx playwright test render-smoke --project=noauth              (against the deployed site)
 *
 * ⚠️ It deliberately does NOT need the API. Every failure above happened while the page was assembling itself,
 * before or independent of any data arriving — so a page that cannot reach the API must still boot cleanly, and
 * "Could not reach the shop" caused by OUR OWN exception must be told apart from a genuine network problem. That
 * distinction is the heart of test 2 below: the storefront was reporting my ReferenceError as a network fault.

   * module was loaded and unique. "Did it boot" and "does it work" are different questions, and a cart that adds
   * but cannot be opened answers the first one yes.

   * out. Any screen that adopts create() is covered by the same three clicks.
