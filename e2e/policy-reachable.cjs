/**
 * policy-reachable.cjs — EVERY POLICY FLAG THE API READS CAN BE SET BY SOMEBODY.
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️ THE BUG THIS GENERALISES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Found 2026-09-12: `tol_weight_bp`, `tol_count_units` and `tol_rate_bp` had been live since 8 September.
 * `routes/till.js` read all three on every receipt and every reconciliation — and NOTHING in the product could
 * change them. Every shop on the platform was running the defaults, and none of them had ever been asked.
 *
 * ⭐ A POLICY NOBODY CAN SEE IS A POLICY NOBODY AGREED TO. That is worse than a missing feature: the number is
 * real, it decides whether a short delivery is a dispute, and it is invisible at both ends — the shopkeeper
 * cannot find it and nothing reports that it was never chosen.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE FAILURE MODE IS SILENCE, WHICH IS WHY IT NEEDS A GUARD RATHER THAN A HABIT. Adding a flag is one line in
 * lib/policy.js; wiring a control is a different repo. Nothing connected the two, exactly like the CORS header
 * list that took the whole app down in August (chitbridge-api/tests/cors-headers.test.cjs, same shape, same fix).
 *
 * ── ⭐ WHAT COUNTS AS REACHABLE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The flag's key appearing anywhere in the web app: the POLICY_FLAGS card in cap-admin.js, a screen of its own
 * (units and languages have one in cap-catsetup.js), or a connector screen. This is deliberately generous — it
 * asks "could a person get at this at all", not "is it on the card I expect".
 *
 * ⚠️ AND A FLAG MAY BE DELIBERATELY UNREACHABLE, but it has to SAY so here, with a reason. A list of exceptions
 * somebody wrote is a decision; an empty result is an assumption.
 *
 * Run: node e2e/policy-reachable.cjs
