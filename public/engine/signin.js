/**
 * lib/signin.js — SIGNING A PERSON IN. One rule set, no surface, callable from anywhere.
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Athi, on clicking "Sign in" at a counter and getting a name picker: *"the counter is empty, now it has to
 * allow the user and provide a counter number? the user could be entity or employee, what we need is a user id
 * screen same as our back office, much simpler, so someone can sign-in? where is the problem here?"*
 *
 * The problem was that three different things shared one word.
 *   · PAIRING A DEVICE — user id and a code, once, and what it leaves behind is a KEY on that PC ([TILL-121]).
 *     A person arriving for a shift should never meet it.
 *   · A NAME ON A BILL — openWho(), a picker whose own last line admits *"it is not a sign-in"*. The header
 *     button was wired to this, so the most prominent control on the screen was mislabelled.
 *   · SIGNING A PERSON IN — which had never been built at all. There was no authenticated person anywhere in
 *     the counter, only a label typed onto bills.
 *
 * ── ⭐⭐⭐ AND IT IS NOT THE BACK OFFICE'S ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Athi: *"we should not think backoffice engine, tightly coupled, it should be independent and also can be
 * called from the backoffice."*
 *
 * So the rules live here and the SURFACE decides what to keep afterwards — which is the only part that really
 * differs between the two, and it differs for a reason worth stating:
 *   · the back office keeps a SESSION, because it is a thing you use while connected.
 *   · a counter keeps the IDENTITY AND NO SESSION, because a session that expires at noon would stop a shop
 *     billing at noon. Signing in fetches who you are; it does not leave a thing that can lapse.
 *     [[project-counter-identity]] [[project-user-id-rule]]
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING HERE MAKES A REQUEST. It says what to ask for and what an answer means; the page or the server
 * does the asking. That is what lets the identical rules run in a browser, on a shop PC and in node.

 * He is exactly right, and the backend already HAS the right logic — it was simply never asked for. /register

 * up, and one is silently created (`else if (req.body.mode === 'login') { refuse } else { create }`). Signing
 * a PERSON IN at a counter is never that — a mistyped id should say so, not spin up a phantom empty shop.
 * `req.body.mode === 'login'` is the ONE flag that turns "create if missing" into "refuse if missing", and it
 * has been sitting in routes/entities.js unused by this file since the day it was written. This is the sign-in
 * dialog's only caller of ask() (usignAsk() in till.html) — since v1.6.0 the ONLY sign-in dialog on either host:

 *
 * Athi: *"There is a real confusion in sign-in procedure in the counter application, can you find out in how
 * many places this procedure exists."*
 *
 * The audit is in docs/counter-signin.md. The short version is that a counter has FOUR acts, all of which a
 * shopkeeper would call "signing in", and until this section existed each one decided for itself what to call
 * itself and which screen to open. Pressing the header button, the ⚙ Settings button and the alert strip —
 * all three labelled "Sign in" — opened three different dialogs, and the morning's own who-is-here step
 * opened a fourth thing that is not a sign-in at all.
 *
 *   ┌ connect ─ a DEVICE is given a KEY.  Once per PC, needs the line, ends in a restart.        [TILL-121]
 *   ├ key ───── a KEY is PASTED in.       The browser counter's only way in — it cannot pair.
 *   ├ signin ── a PERSON proves who they are. Every shift, needs the line, leaves no session.    [TILL-183]
 *   └ handover─ a PERSON hands to another.    Every shift, needs NOTHING, the counter keeps its number.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️⚠️ WHICH ONE A BUTTON MEANS IS NOT A PROPERTY OF THE BUTTON. It is decided by what the counter is
 * holding at that moment — a key or not, a person or not, a browser or a shop PC — which is exactly why it
 * cannot be written into the label at design time, and exactly why three labels drifted apart. The page asks
 * door() and paints the answer. One rule, one place, and it can be tested without a browser.
