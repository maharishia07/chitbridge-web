/**
 * offers-kinds.test.cjs — EVERY KIND IN THE REGISTRY, on a real basket, with the rules the FORM writes.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-03: *"check offer effectively for each type of offers"*.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ WHY THIS IS NOT COVERED BY THE TWO FILES BESIDE IT. offers-promise tests promise() and offers-combined
 * tests stacking, and both were written by reading offers.js — so both fed it the keys offers.js reads. The
 * FORM writes different keys. `promise()` read `min_subtotal`; cap-definitions writes `min_amount`; the promise
 * test passed `min_subtotal` and went green, while every threshold offer a person actually authored advertised
 * nothing at all on any product row. A test that supplies the implementation's own vocabulary can only prove
 * the implementation is self-consistent.
 *
 * ⭐ SO THE RULE HERE IS: the rules in this file are the rules cbDefRuleFields() can produce, and every kind is
 * asserted three ways — the MONEY it moves, the WHY it gives for moving it, and the PROMISE it makes on a row
 * before anything is in a basket. A kind that cannot pass all three cannot be sold with.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE FIRST GUARD IS A COUNT. Adding a KIND to offers.js without a case here is the failure this file exists
 * to catch — a kind nobody exercises looks fine, because a kind that never fires looks like a kind nobody used.
 *
 * Run: node e2e/offers-kinds.test.cjs
