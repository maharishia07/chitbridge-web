/**
 * a11y-contrast.cjs — measure every theme against the level it CLAIMS.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS. The accessibility themes make a PROMISE in the user interface: a card that says
 * "WCAG 2.2 AAA — 7:1" is telling someone with low vision that this theme is safe for them to use. A promise
 * about contrast that was made by eye is not a promise, it is a guess with a standard's name on it. Nobody can
 * look at #3A4046 on #FFFFFF and know whether it is 6.8:1 or 7.2:1 — and the difference is exactly the claim.
 *
 * So each theme DECLARES its level in `a11y.level`, and this tool computes whether it holds. A theme that claims
 * AAA and measures 6.4:1 fails here rather than in front of the person who needed the 7.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT MEASURES BOTH ROLES OF EVERY ACCENT, which is the mistake the theme work kept catching by hand: a colour
 * is used as TEXT on a card and as a FILL with white text on it, and those pull in opposite directions. A green
 * light enough to read as a link is too light to carry a white button label. Both are checked here.
 *
 * WCAG 2.2 thresholds applied:
 *   1.4.3 AA   body text 4.5:1 · large text 3:1
 *   1.4.6 AAA  body text 7:1   · large text 4.5:1
 *   1.4.11     non-text UI (rules, borders, focus rings) 3:1  — applies at EVERY level
 *
 * Run: node e2e/a11y-contrast.cjs        (exit 1 on any failed claim)
