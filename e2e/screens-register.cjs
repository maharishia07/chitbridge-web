 *      that had just been given its own code was the one screen not showing it.
 *   3. `UI.chit2` was read as "design 2 is on screen" when it is really "the last chit read that way", and it
 *      is never cleared -- so a product detail was headed DTL006, a chit that had left the page.
 *
 * ⚠️ THESE ARE SOURCE CHECKS AND THEY PROVE LESS THAN THEY LOOK: they show the fix is still written, not that
