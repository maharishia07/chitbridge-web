 * offers-combined.test.cjs — several offers on one basket, all the way to the minted line.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-03: *"try multiple combination and then see how all works together."*
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM offers-promise. That one tests each kind ALONE. Everything expensive
 * about a promotions engine happens when two of them touch the same basket: which runs first, whether one stops
 * the rest, whether two discounts can land on one line, and — the part nothing tested at all — whether the answer
 * on screen is the answer that reaches the CHIT.
 *
 * ⭐ THE LAST STAGE IS THE POINT. `mint()` below is the compose send path in miniature: the same evaluate, the
 * same line build, the same "price stays, total falls" shape. Until 2026-09-03 the send collected offer IDS and
 * threw the adjustments away — the cart said "1 × free Sunflower Oil, ₹132 off" and the chit charged ₹132.
 *
 * Run: node e2e/offers-combined.test.cjs
