/**
 * delivery-full.spec.js — FULL DELIVERY, end to end.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-14: *"once we complete full round of testing for the full delivery, then focus on partial
 * delivery, then the cost … let us prove one at a time."*
 *
 * This is the first of that sequence: a line ordered, delivered IN FULL, and every consequence that follows.
 * Partial delivery is deliberately NOT tested here — a spec that mixes the two proves neither, because the
 * interesting cases are exactly where they differ.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT MAKES THIS WORTH A SPEC. "Delivered" is not one fact, it is five that must agree: the event is recorded,
 * the arithmetic closes (pending → 0), the line reads complete, the order LOCKS, and both parties' copies say the
 * same thing. Any one of them can be right while another is wrong, and the screen looks fine either way.
 *
 * Watch it:  npx playwright test delivery-full --headed --project=authed
