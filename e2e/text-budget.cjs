/**
 * text-budget.cjs — how much of this product is a LABEL, and how much is an EXPLANATION?
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-19: *"this product is not supposed to have a lot of text inside. It should be simple like a
 * mailbox, no explanation whatsoever… without giving explanation how should people be able to understand how to
 * operate. That is where the challenge is going to be."*
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE TRANSLATION BACKLOG IS MOSTLY AN EXPLANATION BACKLOG. Every sentence of explanation is a sentence that
 * has to be wrapped, translated into every language, reviewed by a native speaker, and kept in step forever. A
 * sentence deleted costs nothing in any language. So the cheapest way to finish localisation is to find the copy
 * that should not exist, and the second cheapest is to translate what is left.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS COUNTS, IT DOES NOT DELETE. Which explanations earn their place is a product judgement and Athi's call
 * — a mailbox has no manual, but it does have an empty state. The tool's job is to make the size of the problem
 * visible, not to decide it.

/**
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE CATALOGUE IS THE WRONG INPUT AND THE FIRST RUN OF THIS TOOL PROVED IT. strings.catalogue.json holds
 * only the LABEL bucket — 468 entries — because strings-extract deliberately sets prose and fragments aside as
 * "needs reassembling first". Measuring explanations against it reported 4%, which is not a small number, it is
 * a wrong one: it excluded the very bucket the explanations live in.
 *
 * So this reads the SOURCE. Every run of text between tags, in every HTML string, whatever bucket it would fall
 * into. That is what a reader actually sees.

 * ⭐⭐ TRIM THE MAILBOX, KEEP THE MANUAL — the split that makes this number actionable (L3, 2026-08-22).
 *
 * The first version reported one pile of 579 explanations and read as an instruction to delete them all. But
 * **cap-legend.js alone holds 69, and the Legend is the screen whose entire job is to explain.** Trimming
 * there is not tightening the product, it is deleting its documentation — and `cap-readiness` (what a standard
 * requires) and `cap-network` (a design tool you reason inside) are the same kind of surface.
 *
 * ⚠️ SO A BIG TOTAL WAS THE WRONG TARGET. Athi's rule is "mailbox not manual": the screens a person works in
 * every day must be terse, and the ones they visit to LEARN are allowed prose. Only the first group is debt.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS LIST IS A JUDGEMENT AND SHOULD BE ARGUED WITH, not treated as measurement. It is here so the
 * judgement is visible and revisable rather than applied silently inside a trim.
