/**
 * e2e/wrap-apply.cjs — wrap the bare LABEL bucket in tx(), one mechanical edit per site.
 *
 * Run with --dry (default) to see every change; run with --apply to make them.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE SAME LABEL NEEDS TWO DIFFERENT EDITS DEPENDING ON WHERE IT SITS, and getting it wrong does not
 * throw — it SHIPS. Inside a template literal the wrap is `${tx('X')}`; inside ordinary string concatenation
 * it is `' + tx('X') + '`. Use the template form in a concatenated string and the reader sees the literal
 * characters `${tx('Save')}` on screen; use the concat form inside a template literal and you break the quote
 * nesting. Neither is caught by `node --check` in every case.
 *
 * ⭐ SO THE CONTEXT IS DETECTED, NOT ASSUMED: count unescaped backticks before the match on that line. An odd
 * number means we are inside a template literal. It is a heuristic, which is exactly why this defaults to a
 * DRY RUN and prints every edit for reading before anything is written.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT REFUSES THE AMBIGUOUS ONES rather than guessing. A line where the label appears more than once, or
 * where quoting cannot be read confidently, is SKIPPED and listed. Ninety mechanical edits plus nine done by
 * hand is a better trade than ninety-nine edits where a few are silently wrong.
