// shop-publish.spec.js — CAN A NEW BUSINESS ACTUALLY OPEN ITS SHOP?
//
// ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS: until 2026-08-18 the answer was NO, and every storefront spec in this suite passed anyway.
// They all used `alpha` and `gamma` — two long-lived accounts whose schemas happened to have been created public
// by an earlier path. So the tests exercised a shop that was ALREADY open and never once exercised the act of
// OPENING one, which is the only part a new customer performs.
//
// The bug: `identities.catalogue_visibility` is what Settings writes; `entity_schemas.visibility` is what
// buildPublicView() requires and what the b49 RLS policy keys off. The second was a snapshot taken during
// REGISTRATION — before the owner could choose — so every entity onboarded through the UI had a private schema
// permanently, and nothing in the front end ever called the route that would change it.
//
// ⚠️ THE SHAPE OF THE MISS IS THE LESSON: a fixture that is already in the end state cannot test the transition
// into it. This spec starts from nothing, every time.
//
