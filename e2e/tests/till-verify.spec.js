// till-verify.spec.js — [TILL-05] A COUNTER CAN PROVE ITSELF, AND A DELETED ROW CANNOT HIDE IN IT.
//
// Athi, 2026-09-09, after emptying a catalogue in SQL and reloading it while his counter went on listing the old rows:
// "i am going crazy now — how to gain confidence it is reading the entire catalogue and also not mixing up, and counter works fine
// and rightly synced."
//
// ⚠️⚠️ THE DEFECT. A delta asks for everything with `updated_at > since`. A DELETED row is not late, it is gone — it appears in no
// result set, so it lands in neither the changes nor the removals and the till's merge keeps it for ever. This spec cannot issue a
// raw SQL delete, so it reproduces the STATE that a delete leaves behind (a copy holding a row the shop does not have) and proves
// the counter notices and heals it. That is the mechanism, tested where it actually lives.
