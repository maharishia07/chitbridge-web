/**
 * money.js — an amount is never a bare number.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-07-31: "The product price cannot be currency-less. Assume someone spoofs the currency, everything is
 * going for a toss."
 *
 * The exposure was never spoofing. Every price in this codebase is a bare number whose denomination is resolved LIVE
 * from `identities.currency_code` at read time — so an entity editing its own currency setting silently redenominates
 * every price it has ever published. Nothing is rewritten and nothing logs. This module makes the denomination travel
 * WITH the amount, so meaning is fixed at write time instead of inferred at read time.
 *
 *   { "amount": 3290, "currency": "INR" }
 *
 * ── THE RULES, and why each is shaped this way ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. IT NEVER CONVERTS. There is no rate table here and no function that takes one. Conversion is a presentation act
 *    or an ERP act; a converted number must never reach a minted record. If you find yourself wanting `convert()`,
 *    what you want is a display overlay in the UI — see BACKLOG-currency-governance.md OPEN 3.
 *
 * 2. `read()` NEVER INVENTS A CURRENCY. A bare legacy number can only be read by passing the currency to assume, and
 *    the result is flagged `assumed: true` so a caller can tell an inferred denomination from a declared one. There
 *    is no default. A module-level fallback here would recreate the exact bug this module exists to end.
 *
 * 3. `amountOf()` RETURNS null FOR ABSENT, NEVER 0. The prevailing idiom in the front end is `+d.price || 0`, which
 *    turns an unreadable price into a FREE PRODUCT rather than an error — silent, and correct-looking on the page.
 *    Returning null forces the caller to decide. Zero is a price; absent is not.
 *
 * 4. `sum()` REFUSES MIXED CURRENCIES. The network-order path aggregates items across several stores, which may be
 *    in different countries. Today `items.reduce((s,i) => s + i.price*i.qty, 0)` will happily add INR to AED and
 *    produce a confident wrong number. This is a LATENT bug that the money type makes visible; sum() throws instead.
 *
 * ── PRECISION — a deliberate non-change ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Amounts stay JS numbers in MAJOR units, exactly as today. Floats are a genuine hazard for money and integer minor
 * units are the correct long-term answer (it is what Medusa does) — but changing precision AND adding currency in one
 * migration means a failure could come from either, and neither is separately reversible. One change at a time.
 * Rounding is centralised in `round2()` so the eventual switch has one place to happen.

 * Right call, and it removes the migration's one unverifiable assumption (that an entity's CURRENT currency is what

 * stamped: `money.make()` existed and was called by no write path in the codebase.

 * ── THE ANTI-SPOOF PROPERTY, and why it is a shape rather than a check ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The currency is taken from the OWNING ENTITY, never from the request. A caller that cannot choose a currency has
 * nothing to spoof, so the guarantee comes from what the function accepts rather than from validation that someone
 * could later relax.
 *
 * One necessary exception, and it is not a hole: a client that READS an item, edits it and writes it back will send
 * the price as `{amount, currency}` — the shape it just read. Rejecting that outright would break every round-trip
 * edit. So a money value is accepted ONLY when its currency already equals the entity's. A DIFFERENT currency is
 * refused, which is precisely the spoof case.
