/* app/cap-chit2.js — DESIGN 2: the chit as LINE-LEVEL work (lazy; ensureCap('chit2')).
 *
 * Athi's design, 2026-08-12 (cb-two-levels.html), and his correction of my framing the same day:
 *   *"design 1 stands for the whole chit and 2 works for division of labour."*
 *
 * ── ⚠️ THIS IS NOT A SKIN OVER DESIGN 1 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The two differ in the ATOM OF WORK, not the look. Design 1: the chit is the unit — one status, one assignee.
 * Design 2: the LINE is the unit — Murugan has the onions, Selvam the potatoes, a co-assist is sourcing beans, all
 * at once. That cannot be rendered as a variant of the first, because it needs state Design 1 has nowhere to put.
 * So this is a separate module on its own route, reading the same endpoints. NOTHING in Design 1 is altered, and
 * the old page keeps working whatever happens here.
 *
 * ── ⭐ TWO LEVELS, AND THE SWITCH IS THE PRIVACY BOUNDARY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   THEM — the shared record: their message, the order, what was delivered and paid. Both parties hold it.
 *   US   — ours alone: who is doing what, internal notes, and what the job has cost. The counterparty sees NONE of it.
 * That is not a UI convenience; it is the isolation decision made visible. Assignment and cost are private tables
 * under RLS, delivery is replicated to both copies. The switch shows a person which world they are typing into.
 *
 * Backend: b138 amendment · b142 chit_line · b143 assignment · b144 delivery · b145 cost.

 * fallback, the wantPick reset, the "query the catalogue by what they WROTE" rule. Each of those is a bug that
 * was found once; a second copy here would mean finding all three again.
 *

 * edit would look lost until a manual reload — the change would be committed and invisible, which is the worst of
 * both outcomes.

 *
 * ⭐ AND THE SUPPLIER LINK IS WHAT MAKES ALL THREE ONE MECHANISM. A network store is another entity, so its

 * relationship is the supplier link. So the source list is: our own shelf, then every supplier we have,
 * whether that supplier is a branch of our own network or an outside business. Nothing here needs to know
 * which, because the LINK already decided we may read their catalogue.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IS RECORDED DIFFERS BY SOURCE, AND THAT MUST NOT BE BLURRED. Taking oil off our own shelf is
 * CONSUMPTION — no counterparty, no agreement. Taking it from another entity is a PURCHASE: they have a price,
 * they hold their own copy, and a record neither side can edit alone. The event below carries the source on
