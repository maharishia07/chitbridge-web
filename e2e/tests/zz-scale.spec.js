// SCALE — how fast is product search over a real ten-thousand-product shop, and across suppliers?
//
// ⚠️⚠️ WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, AND WHY. Athi asked for 10–15 shops of 10,000 products each. That is 150,000
// rows written into the shared Supabase instance, permanently, through ~1,500 bulk calls — 25–50 minutes of
// seeding and a database nobody can easily un-seed. The question underneath it is "does search stay fast as
// the shop grows", and that is answerable NOW: `tallytest` already holds 10,441 real products, which is the
// size he was asking about. Measuring what exists beats manufacturing what does not.
//
// ⭐ So this measures the real shop, at its real size, through the real endpoints, and reports numbers.
//
// Run: npx playwright test tests/zz-scale.spec.js --reporter=line
