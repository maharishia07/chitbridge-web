/* app/offers.js — OFFERS AS A SUBJECT OF THEIR OWN.  (classic script, shared global scope)
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-15: *"there are different type of offers run in different industry, some where product range,
 * price range, plus offer, discount above certain amount and so on, if we think offer is a seperate subject, we
 * can keep it as a js and see how we can call it, similarly tax etc."*
 *
 * He is right, and the reason is structural rather than tidiness: an offer is not a property of a cart, it is a
 * TERM OF TRADE. It has an author, a validity window, a jurisdiction, and it must survive into a dispute intact.
 * Baking "10% off above ₹5,000" into cart-ui would make the cart the authority on commercial policy, which it is
 * not — the same mistake as a screen owning a quantity rule.
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️ WHAT THIS FILE MUST NEVER DO ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * IT NEVER MUTATES A CART, A LINE, OR A PRICE. `evaluate()` is a pure function: catalogue + lines + context in, a
 * BREAKDOWN out. The caller decides what to do with it. That is what lets the same engine run in the cart, on the
 * storefront, in a quote, and again at seal time months later — and get the same answer.
 *
 * ── ⭐ EVERY ADJUSTMENT MUST EXPLAIN ITSELF ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This is the CB-specific requirement and it outranks every feature below. Disputes are the product's USP. When
 * someone asks "why was this ₹7,950 and not ₹8,400?" six months later, the answer cannot be "the engine decided".
 * So every adjustment carries: which offer, which rule fired, what the input was, and what it produced. An offer
 * engine that cannot say WHY is unusable here, however clever its arithmetic.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ NEVER APPLY WHAT WAS NOT EARNED, NEVER SILENTLY IMPROVE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * cart-ui's models refuse rather than round up, because quietly ordering more than someone asked for costs them
 * money. The mirror rule here: never apply an offer whose conditions are not met, and never quietly give a better
 * price than the terms state. A surprise discount is a pricing error that happens to be pleasant, and it is still
 * a number nobody can defend in a dispute.
 *
 * ── THE VOCABULARY IS ADOPTED, NOT INVENTED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Scopes (line / cart / shipping), predicate conditions, stacking order and exclusivity, and validity windows are
 * the standard commerce-platform model (commercetools' pricing & promotions capability, Voucherify's promotion
 * taxonomy). Using their words means a person who has run promotions elsewhere already knows what these mean, and
 * a future integration maps rather than translates.
 *
 * ── ⭐ WIRED. evaluate() is called by the cart (catalogue-ui.offersHTML) and by compose; promise()/forLine()
 * which screen calls it, and whether an offer is frozen at seal, is Athi's decision. See SPEC-offers-tax.md.
