/**
 * ⭐⭐ THIS IS THE CHECKLIST ATHI WAS BEING ASKED TO WALK BY HAND. Everything in it was shipped on guard
 * evidence alone — render-smoke renders markup and a11y-contrast measures colour, and NEITHER looks at layout,
 * at what a control actually does, or at how many requests a screen makes.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ SO EACH TEST HERE ASSERTS AN EFFECT, NOT A PRESENCE. "The text size control exists" is worth nothing —
 * the question is whether the text MOVES when it is used, because 980 font-size declarations were changed on
 * the claim that they now scale, and nothing had confirmed it.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IT STILL CANNOT DO is tell you whether the result looks GOOD. It can prove the type responds and that
 * nothing overflows; it cannot prove the register is right. That judgment stays human, and this narrows it to
 * one look instead of six.

/**
 * ⭐ REACHING A SETTINGS SECTION, AND ASSERTING YOU ARRIVED.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ I BRIEFLY "FIXED" THIS INTO BEING WRONG. Reading `SET_SECS` through a truncated range showed six keys
 * and no `appearance`, so I concluded Appearance had no rail entry and routed this through a link inside
 * Governance. A probe against the live DOM says the rail carries EIGHT: work · policy · channels · governance
 * · blueprints · locale · appearance · standards. `set-sec-appearance` was there all along.
 *
 * ⚠️ READING PART OF A LIST AND CONCLUDING SOMETHING ABOUT THE WHOLE is the same mistake as a scan that
 * under-matches: both report their own blindness as a fact about the code. The probe took forty seconds and
 * settled it; three rounds of reasoning from an artefact did not.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ARRIVAL ASSERTION STAYS — it is what turned "timeout on ap-fs-m" into "the pane did not open",
 * which is the difference between blaming a control and blaming the navigation.
 */
/**
 * ⚠️⚠️ OPEN, AND NOT A TEST BUG: A SETTINGS SECTION INTERMITTENTLY FAILS TO PAINT.
 *
 * Across two identical full runs the SAME three checks failed — but not the same three. Run one lost
 * Localisation; run two lost Appearance and kept Localisation. A locator that is wrong is wrong every time;
 * one that fails on a different section each run is reporting a RACE, not a bad selector.
 *
 * What was ruled out, each by measurement rather than by reasoning:
 *   · the rail item        — `set-sec-locale` is present, and its click does set `setSec()` to 'locale'
 *   · the renderer         — `localeSettingsHTML()` called by hand returns 52,000 characters
 *   · the dispatch         — `paintSettings` has `if (k === "locale") out = localeSettingsHTML()`
 *   · a missing dependency — locale.js is a plain synchronous script, so CBLocale is never late
 *
 * ⭐ WHAT A PERSON SEES WHEN IT HAPPENS is the part worth attention: not a blank pane and not an error, but
 * the CHIT LIST'S empty state — "Your bogie is empty · Compose" — rendered inside Settings. Someone who
 * clicked Localisation is told their rail is empty. ⚠️ `paintSettings` swallows a render throw into
 * `scrErr`, so nothing reaches the console; that is why this has never surfaced as an error report.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT FIXED HERE. The settings screen is Athi's, the failure is intermittent, and a fix aimed at a
 * mechanism I have not identified would be a guess dressed as a repair. The checklist is left FAILING on
 * purpose — a red check that names a real race is worth more than a green one that waits it out.
