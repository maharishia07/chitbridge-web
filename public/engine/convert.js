/**
 * ── ⭐⭐⭐ WHAT A QUANTITY IS WORTH, AND WHO SAID SO ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-15: *"we should be creating a conversion lab, reading data from a chit or a catalogue, convert
 * to another currency, and also read the qty and provide value according to current value, bullion market or
 * commodity market."*
 *
 * Two different questions that look like one:
 *
 *     CURRENCY   ₹1,000 → how many dirhams?            a RATE between two currencies
 *     COMMODITY  12 grams of gold → how much is that?  a PRICE per unit, then currency
 *
 * ⭐ AND THE SECOND ONE IS A CHAIN, WHICH IS WHY THEY BELONG IN ONE FILE: 12 g → price per gram in USD → USD to
 * INR. Two conversions, two rates, two sources, and a reader who deserves to see both.
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️ THE RULE THAT SHAPES EVERYTHING HERE: A RATE IS EVIDENCE, NOT A NUMBER ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * lib/money.js refuses to convert, deliberately and correctly — *"an amount is labelled"*, and a conversion is
 * a claim about the world at a moment. So this file does not quietly do what money.js refuses. It does the
 * conversion ONLY when handed a rate that says where it came from and when, and it returns the workings.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO FEED, ON PURPOSE. A live market price is somebody's paid subscription and somebody else's licence
 * terms, and a hard-coded one is a number that is wrong by tomorrow and lies about it. The rate is an INPUT with
 * a declared provenance: pasted by a person, stored by an operator, or fetched from a source they chose. The
 * engine is the asset; the feed is a plug. [[feedback-adopt-dont-reinvent]]
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT NEVER INVENTS AN INVERSE IT WAS NOT GIVEN… unless asked. `invert: true` says "you may use 1/rate",
 * which is arithmetically fine and commercially often wrong — a bank's buy and sell are not reciprocal. Off by
 * default, and the workings say when it happened.
