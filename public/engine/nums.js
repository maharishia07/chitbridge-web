// lib/numerals.js — the CLOSED CLASS. Numbers, negation, and the words that are never either.
//
// Athi, 2026-08-11: *"we cannot work for a million combinations"* and *"there will be multiple fillers available
// in every language and there will be similar syllable mean differently in language."*
//
// ── ⚠️ WHY THIS IS CODE AND NOT A PROMPT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Vocabulary splits in two and the halves scale oppositely:
//   OPEN class  — product names, qualifiers, dialect. Unbounded, differs per trade. LEARNED from corrections.
//   CLOSED class — numerals, negation, and/or. ~40 tokens per language, finite, and then DONE FOREVER.
// Asking a model to be reliable about the closed half is paying per call, forever, for something a table settles
// once. `pathu kilo` came back as 5 in a live test. That is a money error, and it is not an AI judgment.
//
// ── ⚠️ THE `oru` TRAP — a flat dictionary makes things WORSE, not better ────────────────────────────────────────
// The obvious build (a numeral table, reject the model on mismatch) HALVES real orders, because Athi's own corpus
// contains:
//        "dr fix oru 4 packet"      → 4      "chicken oru 10 piece"  → 10
//        "oru watter bottle"        → 1      "oru pepsi periya bottle" → 1
// `oru` is "a/some" when another numeral follows it, and 1 when none does. Encoding the table without this rule
// would have been confidently wrong on two of five lines — worse than not checking at all, because the check
// would carry authority.
//
// ── ⚠️ WHAT THIS FILE NEVER DOES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// It never picks a quantity. It VERIFIES one, and when it disagrees the answer is `null` + a flag — never a
// substitution. A checker that silently overwrites the model has simply become a second, dumber model.

 * has no single correct romanisation, and every speaker transliterates by ear. So the closed class is finite in
 * MEANING and effectively unbounded in SPELLING, and enumerating spellings from a desk cannot work: I proved that
 * by writing three of the four and missing the one he actually types.
 *
 * ⚠️ A TIE IS FINE WHEN THE CANDIDATES AGREE. `irupadhu` is one edit from BOTH `irubadhu` and `irupathu` — and
 * both mean 20, so there is nothing to be ambiguous about. It is only a refusal when two candidates disagree on
 * the VALUE, which is the case that would put a wrong number on an order.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND SHORT TOKENS ARE EXCLUDED. `anju`(5), `aaru`(6), `ettu`(8) are four letters; one edit connects several
