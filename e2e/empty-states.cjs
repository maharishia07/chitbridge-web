/**
 * e2e/empty-states.cjs — an empty screen is the FIRST screen, so there is one of them.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE HELPER EXISTED AND 22 SITES BYPASSED IT. helpers.js has had emptyState(icon,title,sub,act) and
 * scrErr(e,subject,retry) for weeks; the app kept hand-rolling `<div class="empty">…` anyway, because writing
 * the markup inline is always slightly easier than finding the function. Nothing forced them together, so they
 * drifted — three spellings of "Couldn't load", two different icons for the same absence, and one site
 * (cap-intake) that wore `class="empty"` while re-specifying every measurement inline, which reads as "uses
 * the shared empty state" to anyone scanning and is not.
 *
 * ⭐ WHAT THE HELPER BUYS IS NOT TIDINESS, IT IS THE ACTION. An empty screen is what a new user and every
 * prospect sees before there is any data. Ours NAMED the next step in prose — "or add a new one", "use Compose
 * to add your first chit" — and then made them go find the button. Naming an action without offering it is the
 * one thing an empty state must never do: it is the only moment where the app knows exactly what the person
 * should do next.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE RULE IS NOT "NEVER WRITE class=empty". Two states legitimately are not empty states, and pretending
 * otherwise would push someone into using the wrong primitive: the capability-loading placeholder in app.html
 * (a wait, not an absence) and the two primitives in helpers.js themselves.
