/**
 * ⭐ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (2026-08-16).
 *
 * Two real bugs shipped past `node --check`, past guard-static, and past a green suite, and were caught only
 * because a person looked at the screen:
 *
 *   · the supplier Edit button rendered WHITE ON WHITE — `.composebtn` sets color:#fff for a coloured
 *     background, and the rule beside it set background:#fff. The button was present, sized, clickable and
 *     invisible. Every locator found it. Every assertion passed.
 *   · the "‹ Suppliers" back button carried `.dback`, which is `display:none` outside mobile — so on a laptop
 *     the Find-a-product panel covered the list with NO WAY OUT. Athi hit it in the first minute.
 *
 * Neither is visible in source: both need computed styles on a rendered page. That is exactly the seam between
 * guard-static (cheap, textual, every save) and the specs (real browser, real cascade).
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS FILE ASSERTS PERCEIVABILITY, NOT TASTE. It cannot tell you a layout is ugly or a label is confusing —
 * the "Shop status" vs "Is your shop open?" collision was found by reading both labels and being confused, and
 * nothing here would have caught it. It catches only the mechanical failures: text that cannot be read, and
 * controls that cannot be reached.
