/**
 * e2e/session-keys.cjs — a SESSION property that is read but never written is silently always-undefined.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS. cap-admin.js gated the entire employee profile on `SESSION.identity_type`, a property
 * NOTHING in this codebase assigns. It parsed, it ran, it threw nothing, and it returned false for every user
 * — so a screen that was built, reviewed, committed, deployed and served had never once rendered. Athi found
 * it by asking "is it reflecting in localhost? I am there as an employee." The honest answer was no.
 *
 * ⭐ THAT IS THE WHOLE CLASS: a helper written against a REMEMBERED name is not a crash, it is a silent
 * always-false. JavaScript will not tell you, a parse check will not tell you, and a code review will not
 * either — because the name reads perfectly plausibly. Only comparing readers against writers tells you.
 *
 * It immediately found a second, older one: cap-workforce.js read `SESSION.entity_id` (the real name is
 * `entityId`), so the AI-policy localStorage key silently collapsed to a shared 'cb_aipolicy_me' whenever
 * SESSION.name was absent — two businesses on one browser sharing one policy store.

 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ IT COST WEEKS ONCE ALREADY. `networkScreen` and `loadNetwork` were declared in BOTH app.html and
 * app/cap-network.js. The later script wins, so the design-first builder is what ran — but which one wins is a
 * coin toss decided by load order, and nothing failed, nothing warned, and `node --check` is perfectly happy
 * with two declarations of one name in two files. It was found by reading, not by any test, and only after the
 * static guard had been printing it as a WARNING that nobody acted on.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SYMPTOM IS THE PROBLEM: the dead one is not dead, it is *shadowed* — reachable the instant load order
 * changes, or before the later file loads. Deleting the app.html pair was safe only because the router waits
 * for `_capLoading` to clear; without that it would have been a crash rather than a stale screen.
 *
