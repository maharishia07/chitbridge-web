 *   · CBAction                   — the action-state helper: busy · confirm for irreversible writes · outcome (M64)
 *   · CBLedger                   — the Ledger's SWITCH: the words, the confirm, the call, in one place. The Settings

 * ⭐⭐ CBAction — THE ACTION-STATE HELPER (M64, 2026-10-07). Every control that WRITES goes through this, so that three
 * promises hold everywhere instead of wherever somebody remembered them:
 *   1  ONE PRESS, ONE WRITE. While the action is out (or its confirm is open) the button is disabled + aria-busy, and a
 *      second press of the same action — the same `key`, even on a button a repaint replaced — is dropped.
 *   2  AN IRREVERSIBLE WRITE ASKS FIRST, in the page's own dialog (confirmAsk in the app; CBConfirm on CB Accounts / CRM /
 *      the index tile). Cancel, Escape or the backdrop sends nothing. Never the browser's confirm(): it blocks automation.
 *   3  THE OUTCOME IS SAID WHERE THE ACTION HAPPENED — `out` (an element or its id beside the control) or the toast.
 *      No silent success, no silent failure. A JavaScript error's text never reaches the person: only a server's own
 *      reason for refusing (a 4xx with words) is shown; everything else gets the caller's `failed` sentence.
 *
 *   CBAction.run(button, fn, {
 *     key,                       // the action's identity; default the button's data-testid or id
 *     confirm: { title, body, yes, danger },   // irreversible → ask first (body is HTML; escape what you put in it)
 *     busy,                      // optional words on the button while it works ("Recording…")
 *     out,                       // where to say the outcome (element or id); default the toast
 *     done,                      // the success sentence (when there is no outcome painter)
 *     outcome(value),            // paints the result where it happened — flip the ROW, never the screen
 *     failed,                    // the failure sentence when the server gave no reason
 *     onFail(words, err)         // the caller shows the failure itself (e.g. into the form)
 *   }) → Promise<{ ok, value, cancelled, skipped, error }>   — never throws
 *
 *   CBAction.once(key, button, fn) — the busy half alone, for a write whose caller already says its outcome
 *   (bkOnce in cap-books.js IS this, widened from there — one guard, not two).
 *   CBAction.words(err, fallback) — what a failure says to a person.
 *
 * The button carries data-action-state = busy · done · failed · idle, so a test (and a stylesheet) can read it.
 * Every writing control and whether it uses this: docs/ACTION-STATE-SWEEP.md (node scripts/action-state-sweep.cjs).
