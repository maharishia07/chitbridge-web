// [LAB-01] THE OFFER LAB, ON THE REAL CATALOGUE — and an offer attached to a CATEGORY, overridden on one product.
//
// Athi, 2026-09-11: "can you bring the real catalogue into offer lab instead of test data — which entity opens and
// its catalogue", "anything should be possible", and "if it is attached to a category it applies to all products;
// one or two products we should be able to override with different offers."
//
// ⚠️ WHY A SPEC AND NOT A UNIT TEST. The lab COULD already read the real catalogue — it was a button nobody
// pressed, so it opened on five invented products and a shop proving an offer was proving it against a shop that
// does not exist. That failure has no symptom: the numbers are all correct, for the wrong catalogue.
