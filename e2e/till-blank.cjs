/* till-blank.cjs — WHAT A COUNTER CONNECTED TO NOTHING SAYS ([TILL-119])
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-19: *"currently, if i give clear and reload it should say, you are not connected, no store id
 * exists etc?"*
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️⚠️ IT PARTLY DID, AND THE TWO SENTENCES THAT MATTERED MOST WERE BOTH WRONG ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The header was honest: "Not paired yet", "no key yet", "no prices yet", "nobody signed in". The body was not:
 *
 *   ⚠️⚠️ the footer said **"everything has reached ChitBridge"** — on a counter that has never reached
 *     ChitBridge at all. The queue is empty because nothing was ever taken, not because everything arrived. It
 *     is the line a shopkeeper reads before closing the shutters, and it was a false all-clear.
 *
 *   ⚠️ the shelf said **"press ↻ once, while online"** — advice that CANNOT BE FOLLOWED, because with no key ↻
 *     has nothing to ask. It sent a person to press a button that would do nothing and say nothing.
 *
 * ⭐ THE RULE: the advice must match the state. No key → pair it. Key but no shop → read the shop.
 * [[feedback-write-for-the-shopkeeper]] [[feedback-silence-is-the-bug]]
 *
 * Run: node e2e/till-blank.cjs [--shots]
