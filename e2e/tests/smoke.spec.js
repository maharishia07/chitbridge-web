/**
 * ⚠️ THIS LIST DRIFTED FROM THE RAIL AND THE TEST SAID NOTHING.
 *
 * The loop below skips any entry it cannot find — "capability-gated, don't fail" — which was reasonable when
 * written and became a hole the moment the rail changed. On 2026-08-15 `folders`, `profile`, `settings` and
 * `assistreview` all left the rail (folders now hang under their tracks; profile and settings moved behind the
 * avatar). SMOKE-01 kept passing while silently testing 4 fewer screens than it claimed. A safety net that
 * quietly gets smaller is worse than no net, because the green tick is doing the reassuring.
 *
 * So the list is now split: what MUST be in the rail, and what is reachable ELSEWHERE and gets asserted where it
 * actually lives. Neither can be skipped without failing.
