 * ── ⚠️⚠️ normUnit IS BACK, AND THE STORY IS THE ARGUMENT FOR THIS WHOLE TEST BOARD ──────────────────────────
 *
 * On 2026-08-17 this file gained `normUnit()` and a multilingual alias table, on Athi's approval, because
 * `கிலோ` and `kg` were two different units to every totalling path and SIX ITEMS ON THE LIVE SHOP were wrong.
 * Its own header recorded the fix: *"0 kg + 8 கிலோ now totals to 8."*
 *
 * On 2026-09-05 the file was rewritten around UN/ECE Rec 20 and GST UQC codes — a good change — and the
 * language table and `normUnit` went with it. Nothing was updated: `lib/consolidate.js` still calls
 * `uom.normUnit()` at three places, so wholesaler consolidation has been throwing a TypeError ever since, on
 * a path `routes/capture.js` reaches from every WhatsApp message.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE TEST THAT WOULD HAVE CAUGHT IT WAS BROKEN BY THE SAME COMMIT. `units-alias.test.js` and
 * `consolidate-units.test.js` both went red that day and stayed red among twenty-six other reds, where a
 * genuine regression is indistinguishable from stale tooling until somebody reads all of them.
 *
 * ⭐ `normUnit` is kept as the exported name because three live call sites and a comment use it, and because
 * it says what it does: FOLD a spelling onto the canonical unit. `unitOf` is the same function.
 */
/**
 * ⚠️⚠️ normUnit IS NOT unitOf, AND ALIASING THEM WOULD HAVE SHIPPED A WORSE BUG THAN THE ONE BEING FIXED.
 *
 * `unitOf` answers "which of our units is this?" and returns NULL when it does not know. `normUnit` answers
 * "fold this spelling onto its canonical form" and, when it does not know the word, RETURNS THE WORD.
 *
 * ⭐ That difference is the whole of the bucketing behaviour in `lib/consolidate.js`. With null, every unknown
 * unit in an order collapses into ONE bucket — two gunny bags and three petti would total together as a single
 * quantity of nothing. Surviving unchanged keeps them apart, which is the documented rule: *"an unknown unit
 * SURVIVES — it is never mapped to a guess or dropped."*
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IS STILL MISSING, SAID PLAINLY: the old `normUnit(word, entityMap)` took a second argument — a
 * per-entity taught vocabulary, so a shop could teach the system its own word for a unit without redefining
 * anybody else's. That feature went with the rewrite and is NOT restored here, because bringing back a
 * governance feature is Athi's call, not a regression fix. `tests/units-alias.test.js` still fails on those
 * cases and should, until it is decided.

 * eight of its twelve checks died on "sameUnit is not a function" before asserting anything. The suite was not
 * reporting a unit bug; it was reporting its own missing import, which is the least useful red there is.
 *
 * ⚠️ BOTH ARE DERIVED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. sameUnit is normUnit applied twice; aliasesOf reads the
 * table that is already exported. Neither decides anything, so neither can change what a quantity MEANS — the
 * one risk this file's header is written around. This is exporting what the module already knows.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ WHAT IS STILL NOT RESTORED, deliberately: the per-entity taught vocabulary, `normUnit(word, entityMap)`.
 * Four checks in that suite still fail on it and SHOULD. The header above calls it Athi's decision rather than
 * a regression fix, and quietly reinstating a governance feature to turn a red green would be the worst reason
 * to ship one.
