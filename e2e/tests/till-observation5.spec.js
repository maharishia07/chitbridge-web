// [TILL-08] OBSERVATION 5 — everything Athi found by using the counter on 2026-09-10, driven through the real page.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THESE ARE WORTH A SPEC AND NOT A UNIT TEST. Every figure in his four screenshots was CORRECT. What was
// wrong was what the counter said about them — a word doing two jobs, an offer that named itself twice, a
// discount with no offer named at all. None of that is visible to arithmetic; all of it is visible to a person,
// and it cost him his confidence in the product ("I am now totally out of confidence").
//
// ⭐ So this drives the SCREEN and reads the WORDS. It is the only kind of test that could have caught any of it.
