/**
 * variant.js — ONE PRODUCT, MANY COMBINATIONS, AND A NAME FOR EACH ([TILL-76] / CBVariant)
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-19: *"that need not be only a restaurant problem, i could visualise in multiple other
 * industries too — same product, but combinations can be different. in the cart, it has to be identified as a
 * separate item, possibly product code with some other field to distinguish it differently. if the same choice
 * is chosen again, it has to be added to the existing cart."*
 *
 * And: *"these are all should be as a module and we should be able to re-use… a proper write-up has to be
 * there, can we create a helper function so we can re-use where required."*
 *
 * ── ⭐⭐⭐ WHAT THIS IS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A VARIANT is a product plus the choices made about it. Paneer pizza with cola and paneer pizza with pepsi
 * are one product and two variants. So are 8mm rod cut to 4 ft and to 6 ft; a shirt in blue/L and blue/M; a
 * service with next-day rather than standard delivery. It is not a restaurant idea — it is what happens
 * whenever a catalogue entry is narrower than the thing actually sold.
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️ THE RULE EVERYTHING HERE EXISTS TO KEEP ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   **The same set of choices must always produce the same name, and a different set must never produce it.**
 *
 * Break the first half and a bill grows two identical rows — a kitchen makes two of something ordered once, a
 * warehouse picks twice. Break the second and two different things merge into one line and somebody receives
 * the wrong goods. Both failures are silent: the arithmetic stays correct and the bill is simply wrong.
 *
 * ⭐ THE NAME IS `item_id | group:option, …` SORTED. Sorting is the whole trick: a signature built in the order
 * somebody happened to tap is not a signature, it is a recording of their hand movements. This engine was
 * extracted the day that bug was found — inside a group allowing two extras, Paneer-then-Cheese and
 * Cheese-then-Paneer were two different lines.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ WHAT THIS ENGINE DOES NOT DO ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does not hold a cart, price a bill, or know what a line is. It answers four questions about a set of
 * choices — what is it called, what does it cost, how do we say it, and is it complete — and every surface
 * that sells (the counter, the storefront, order capture, the connector) asks the same one. A second opinion
 * about whether two combinations are the same is how two systems come to disagree about one order.
 * [[project-js-unification]] [[feedback-no-duplicate-functions]]
 *
 * ── HOW TO USE IT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   var groups = CBVariant.groupsOf(product);           // what may be chosen, [] when nothing may
 *   var missing = CBVariant.missing(groups, chosen);    // required groups still unanswered, by name
 *   var key     = CBVariant.keyOf(product.item_id, chosen);   // the line's identity — merge on this
 *   var extra   = CBVariant.addedPrice(chosen);         // what the choices add to one unit
 *   var words   = CBVariant.words(chosen, money);       // "Hot · Paneer +₹20.00"
 *   CBVariant.same(a, b)                                // do two sets of choices mean the same thing
 *
 * A CHOICE is `{ group, option, price }`. Nothing else is read, so any surface can build one.
