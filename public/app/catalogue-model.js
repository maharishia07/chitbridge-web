   *
   *   s — schema.org (Product properties, or Offer.* where the standard puts it on the offer, not the product)
   *   m — Medusa (MIT). Field names read from the Product / ProductVariant model references, 2026-08-13.
   *   o — the other governing standard, where one owns the field outright (WCO HS, ISO, UN/CEFACT, GS1)
   *   n — a note, and always the reason when we differ
   *
   * ⚠️ VOCABULARY ONLY — NO MEDUSA CODE IS EMBEDDED, exactly as the PIM entry above already states. Reading a
   * model to name our own fields well is not vendoring it.
   *
   * ⚠️ TWO THINGS THIS MAP MADE VISIBLE, both recorded in FIELD_GAPS/CONFLICTS below rather than silently fixed:
