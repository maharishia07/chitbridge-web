/* offer-nudge-gap.cjs — "ADD ONE MORE AND IT IS FREE": THE SILENCE, PROVED FIRST. (M60 · a KNOWN GAP, pinned)
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-11: *"When you have buy 2 get 1 free … in online, if two selected, are we notifying that add one more
 * at free of cost?"* — and *"keep it as a backlog as one of the testing we will do that later."* So this is the
 * test he asked for FIRST: the real offers engine, a storefront basket, the one unit short.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT PINS TODAY'S BEHAVIOUR, INCLUDING THE GAP. A basket of 2 on "buy 2 get 1 free" gets no adjustment AND NO NOTE —
 * while a threshold offer on a short basket DOES say "₹300 more needed". When the engine learns the nudge (an
 * engines release: buy_x_get_y / mix_and_match emitting a note with the shortfall in UNITS, under a name that cannot
 * be read as rupees), the "silence" line below must be MOVED to assert the note — never deleted. The counter must
 * keep NOT showing it (the shopkeeper is holding the packets); that half is the storefront's to render.
 *
 * Run: node e2e/offer-nudge-gap.cjs
