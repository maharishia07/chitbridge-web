/**
 * missing-functions.cjs — a CALL to a function that is not there anywhere.
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On 2026-09-13 Athi asked *"in the screen incident 2, but couldn't click the link for incident and see what
 * those are?"* The count was fine. `testRaisedHTML` DID NOT EXIST — a patch the day before had replaced a whole
 * REGION of cap-testing.js between two anchors and the function was sitting inside it. Never edited, never
 * mentioned in the commit, never missed.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ AND EVERY GUARD PASSED. `node --check` is happy: a call to a missing function is perfectly valid
 * JavaScript until the line runs. dup-functions.cjs looks for two of a name, not none. Sixteen Playwright specs
 * were green because not one of them ever opened that tab. The only symptom was a tab that did nothing when
 * pressed, and the only person who found it was the user.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE SHAPE THAT MAKES THIS CHECKABLE is the codebase's own naming: these files are full of `testX`, `catX`,
 * `wlX` families declared at column zero and called by name across files that share one window. So a call to
 * `somethingLikeThis(` that matches NO declaration and NO known global is a real finding rather than noise.
 *
 * ⚠️ DELIBERATELY NARROW, because a broad checker gets switched off. It only looks at calls whose name matches a
 * PREFIX that this codebase declares functions under, and it knows the browser and library globals. Anything
 * it cannot be sure about it stays quiet on: the cost of a false alarm here is that the next person stops
 * reading the output, and then the guard is worth nothing.
 *
 * Run: node e2e/missing-functions.cjs      (exit 1 on any call with no declaration)

 * name into the world:
 *
 *   const f = (a) => …        an indented arrow — cap-legend.js's govChips

 *
 * ⭐ AND A CALL GUARDED BY `typeof f === 'function'` IS NOT A FAULT, it is the codebase asking politely
 * whether an optional capability has been loaded yet. Reporting those would mean reporting the correct
 * pattern as an error.

 *   "This is everything supOpenProfile() used to hide behind a Details › chip"
