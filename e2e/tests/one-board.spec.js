// [BOARD] ONE BOARD FOR THE PRODUCT — a brand-new shop sees the same cases as everybody else.
//
// ── ⚠️⚠️ WHAT THIS CATCHES, AND WHY IT IS WORTH A SPEC OF ITS OWN ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Athi, 2026-09-13: he signed in as a second shop ("alpha timers") and the report came back EMPTY. The board
// held ChitBridge's OWN test suite — CAT001, RAL002, DTL001, the same screens for every shop, seeded from a
// file in the repo — but it was stored per-entity, so every tenant that pressed "Load cases" got a PRIVATE
// COPY and two people testing the product from two logins had two boards that could never see each other.
// Product data wearing tenant clothing. His call: *"make it platform data, one board for the product."*
//
// ⭐ The switch is lib/testboard.js + TEST_BOARD_ENTITY. This spec is the only thing that can tell the
// difference between "the switch is on" and "the switch is set to an entity that happens to be empty" — both
// of which look like a working deployment from the outside.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS DELIBERATELY TOLERANT OF THE SWITCH BEING OFF. Unset, the board is per-entity and a fresh shop
// SHOULD see nothing; that is the documented fallback, not a failure. The spec asserts the two states are
// each internally consistent and reports which one it found, rather than hard-failing a legitimate config.
//
// Run: npx playwright test tests/one-board.spec.js --reporter=line
