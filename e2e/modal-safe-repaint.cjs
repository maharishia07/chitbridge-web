/**
 * modal-safe-repaint.cjs — A BACKGROUND READ MUST NEVER REPAINT OVER SOMEONE'S OPEN WORK.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THIS BUG HAS NOW HAPPENED THREE TIMES, and the codebase already documented it after the first:
 *
 *   > "renderApp() rebuilds the whole shell, and the shell template contains an EMPTY `<div id="modalhost">`.
 *   > So any renderApp while a modal is open deletes that modal — and everything typed into it… Reproduced:
 *   > modalhost went from 3.7kB to 0 while idling inside compose."
 *
 * `bgRenderApp()` was written in answer to it and yields while a modal is up. But it was applied to the two
 * call sites known at the time, and **thirteen loaders kept calling `renderApp()` directly** — including one I
 * added myself the day before writing this. A fix applied to the instances rather than to the CLASS is a fix
 * with a shelf life.
 *
 * ⭐ THE RULE, and why it is exactly this narrow: a LOADER resolves whenever the network feels like it, which
 * may be a second after the person opened a modal and started typing. A navigation, a send or a screen change
 * is different — the person just asked for it, so it must always paint. That distinction is why this forbids
 * `renderApp()` in `load*` functions and nowhere else.
 *
 * ⚠️ `bgRenderApp()` is not a weaker paint: with no modal open it repaints identically. It only declines to
 * destroy something a person is in the middle of.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-23, on the third occurrence: *"add the guard."*
