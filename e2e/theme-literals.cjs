/**
 * theme-literals.cjs — a colour written as a LITERAL is a colour the theme cannot reach.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ WHY THIS IS A THIRD TOOL AND NOT A CASE OF THE OTHER TWO. a11y-contrast.cjs measures the theme TOKENS —
 * it proves #3A4046 on #FFFFFF really is 7:1, and it is blind to anything not declared as a token.
 * token-check.cjs proves every `var(--x)` resolves — it is blind to a colour that never asks for a token at all.
 * A hardcoded `color:#1d2530` inside a JS template string passes both, cleanly, and is invisible on a dark card.
 * Three different questions: is the token right · does the token exist · WAS A TOKEN USED.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THIS IS THE FAILURE ATHI REPORTED. A product-row status chip stored its colours as DATA — three
 * [text, background, label] triples in an array, interpolated into a style attribute at render time. No scan of
 * `background:` could see them, so every pass walked past and they stayed light: a pale sand chip on a dark row.
 *
 * WHAT IT RANKS AS CRITICAL — a literal that is invisible in one of the two grounds:
 *   · dark ink with NO background beside it   → vanishes on a dark theme
 *   · light ink with NO background beside it  → vanishes on a light theme
 * A literal text colour PAIRED with a literal background is a self-consistent island: it ignores the theme, but
 * it stays readable in both, so it is a warning and not a failure.
 *
 * ⭐ SOME SURFACES ARE DELIBERATELY SINGLE-THEME — a printable card, an exported PDF, a certificate. Those are
 * not bugs, they are a decision, so they declare it in EXEMPT below WITH A REASON rather than being silently
 * skipped. An exemption nobody wrote a reason for is indistinguishable from an oversight.
 *
 * Run: node e2e/theme-literals.cjs        (exit 1 on any critical)

/**
 * ⭐⭐ ONLY INLINE `style="…"` IS IN SCOPE, AND THE REASON IS THE CASCADE. A literal in a stylesheet rule has a
 * ground supplied by an ancestor — `.topbar .ham{color:#fff}` is white on the topbar's own dark bar, and reading
 * that line alone reports a bug that is not there. I flagged 26 of them before checking, which is exactly the
 * mistake this comment exists to stop anyone repeating. A theme can also re-skin a class; it cannot reach into a
 * style attribute. So the attribute is where a literal is FINAL, and that is the only place this fails a build.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND A GROUND IS A GROUND WHATEVER ITS VALUE, AND WHEREVER ON THE LINE IT IS WRITTEN. Two separate
 * corrections, both found by checking a sample before fixing anything. A background painted by a VARIABLE is
 * unknowable here, but the ink is plainly not floating — so ANY background declaration counts, not only a literal
 * or a var(). And a style attribute built by concatenation is not one quoted string: the source reads
 * style="' + rnd + ';background:' + a + ';color:#fff", so pairing quotes finds a fragment holding the ink and not
 * the ground, and reports every coloured button in the cart as invisible white text. The LINE is the unit for the
 * ground; the presence of style= on it is the unit for scope.
 *
 * ⭐ The cost of that widening is stated rather than hidden: a line painting two elements, one with a ground and
 * one without, is read as safe. That is a MISS, not a false alarm — the direction to err in for a guard that
 * fails a build.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE ONE PLACE IT ERRS THE OTHER WAY is an element built across several lines — the recall banner opens with a
 * gradient ground on one line and writes its ink two lines down, so the ink looks unhosted. Left as-is rather than
 * widened to a window: a window big enough to catch it is also big enough to accept the ground of the element
 * ABOVE, and a guard that accepts a neighbour's ground stops being a guard. The banner was tokenised instead,
 * which is the outcome wanted anyway.
