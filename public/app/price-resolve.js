/* app/price-resolve.js — WHICH PRICE APPLIES, AND WHY.  (classic script, shared global scope)
 *
 * Part D of a catalogue has declared tiered, regional, time-boxed pricing since it was written:
 *
 *     pricing: [{ label, basis, by, source, amount, currency, region, validFrom, validTo,
 *                 origin, url, ref, at, as_read }]
 *
 * `cap-network.js` can author those entries — date pickers, region, a "frozen / loose · resolves at seal" badge.
 * ⚠️ AND NOTHING HAS EVER EVALUATED THEM. `cart-ui.priceOf()` reads one scalar off the item, so a catalogue could
 * declare a Diwali price for Tamil Nadu valid to 15 November and the cart would charge the flat number anyway.
 * The authoring existed, the meaning did not.
 *
 * This is the same gap `offers.js` had until it was wired, and it takes the same posture:
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️ PURE. IT RESOLVES, IT NEVER CHARGES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Entries in, a decision out. It mutates nothing, fetches nothing, and knows nothing about carts. That is what
 * lets the same function answer in the cart, on the storefront, in a quote, and again at seal time months later
 * and give the same answer — which is the only reason a price is defensible at all.
 *
 * ── ⭐ IT EXPLAINS ITSELF, INCLUDING WHAT LOST ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `resolve()` returns the winning entry AND every entry it rejected with the reason. "Why am I paying 340 and not
 * 325?" must have an answer six months later, and "the system decided" is not one. This is the same rule offers.js
 * follows and for the same reason: disputes are the product.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ NOT WIRED. Nothing calls this yet. Where it plugs in (and whether a `by:'ref'` price may resolve at seal
 * without a human) is a decision, not a detail. See SPEC-offers-tax.md.
