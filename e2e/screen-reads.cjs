/**
 * screen-reads.cjs — HOW MANY ROUND TRIPS DOES ONE SCREEN COST TO PAINT?
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-20: *"Just to bring the profile, are we looping or does it all get in a single read? If
 * multiple reads that has to be optimised... we have to see how to reduce."*
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE PROFILE HAD GROWN TO FIVE INDEPENDENT READS AND I WROTE FOUR OF THEM MYSELF, ONE PER FEATURE, IN A
 * SINGLE DAY. Each was individually reasonable — latched, additive, failing silently. Together they are the
 * round-trip problem this codebase already knows it has (~250 ms per statement Railway↔Supabase). **Nothing
 * measured it, so nothing objected.** That is the whole finding: the fault was not the fourth fetch, it was
 * that adding a fetch cost nobody anything.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ SO THIS IS A RATCHET, NOT A LIMIT. It records what each screen costs TODAY and fails only when a screen
 * gets WORSE. A hard threshold would fail on the day it was written and be deleted by the afternoon; a ratchet
 * is green from the first run, forbids the drift that actually happened, and tightens by itself every time a
 * screen is genuinely improved (`--update` refuses to raise a budget without `--allow-raise`).
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ AND THE READS DO NOT FIRE WHERE ANYONE WOULD LOOK FOR THEM. Four of the profile’s five live in
 * `iamMeHTML()` and `iamSelfEmployeeHTML()` — functions that BUILD MARKUP and start network requests as a side
 * effect (latched, so they fire once). That is why walking from screen entry points found two: the entry point
 * is not where the cost is. So render functions are entries here too, which is the only reason the number is
 * about the real application rather than about its call graph.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE COUNT IS NEITHER A FLOOR NOR A CEILING — an earlier draft of this header claimed it was a floor,
 * which was simply wrong. Branches mean fewer reads may actually run; deeper chains mean more may. It is
 * "statically reachable within depth", and its value is entirely in COMPARING IT TO YESTERDAY, not in its
 * absolute size. Depth 3 was tried first and leaked through shared dispatchers into the whole app (26 reads
 * for the profile); depth 1 alone missed the render path. Both together are the honest middle.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, STATED PLAINLY: this is static reachability over `function name(...)` bodies. It
 * follows named calls up to MAX_DEPTH and counts `api('key')` sites. It does not resolve dynamic dispatch,
 * callbacks passed as values, or anything behind `ensureCap`.
 *
 * Run:  node e2e/screen-reads.cjs                report + fail on any screen over budget
 *       node e2e/screen-reads.cjs --update       record today's counts as the budget
 *       node e2e/screen-reads.cjs --detail NAME  which api() calls one screen reaches, and via what
