/**
 * cb-build-guard.cjs — A CAPABILITY CHANGED AND THE CACHE-BUSTER DID NOT. THE FIX CANNOT REACH ANYBODY.
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️ THE DAY THIS COST ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 2026-09-12. The test lab gained a menu tree, a full-screen size, two rewritten empty states and a fixed
 * refresh. All of them shipped. None of them could reach a browser, because every lazily-loaded file is fetched
 * as `/app/cap-<name>.js?v=' + CB_BUILD` and CB_BUILD still said `2026-09-11b` — so every browser that had
 * already seen that version kept serving yesterday's file.
 *
 * ⭐ It was found by testing the PRODUCT rather than the code: a fix was applied, the page reloaded, the button
 * pressed, and nothing happened — because the browser was running the old file. Nothing in the build said a
 * word. A fix that cannot be fetched is not a fix.
 *
 * ── ⭐ WHAT THIS ASKS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * For every file fetched with `?v=CB_BUILD`: was it changed AFTER the commit that last set the current
 * CB_BUILD? And is it changed right now in the working tree while CB_BUILD is not? Either way the answer is a
 * red, and the fix is one line.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE EAGER FILES ARE DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE. `core.js`, `cart.js` and their siblings are loaded by plain
 * `<script src="/app/core.js">` with no version at all — they are a different caching question (HTTP
 * revalidation), and pretending this guard covers them would be worse than saying so.
 *
 * Run: node e2e/cb-build-guard.cjs        exit 1 when the cache-buster is stale
