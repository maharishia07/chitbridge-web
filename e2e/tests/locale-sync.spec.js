// locale-sync.spec.js — b165: does the reader's choice actually follow the PERSON?
//
// ⚠️ THIS IS THE ONLY TEST THAT CAN PROVE b165, because the whole feature is about what happens on a device the
// person has never used. Everything else about localisation can be checked in one browser; "your language
// follows you" cannot. So this test deliberately DESTROYS local state and reloads — that erasure is the
// experiment, not a side effect of it.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ IT WRITES TO THE SHARED ACCOUNT, AND THAT IS WHY EVERY PATH RESTORES. In the `authed` project mintEntity
// reuses one long-lived entity, so a locale left behind here would re-format money and dates for every spec that
// runs afterwards — and those specs would fail somewhere else entirely, with no clue pointing back here. The
// restore lives in `finally` so it also runs when an assertion throws, which is exactly when a half-applied
// change would otherwise be left lying around.
