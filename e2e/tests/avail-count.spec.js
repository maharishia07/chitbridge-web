// [AVAIL] THE AVAILABILITY CHIPS COUNT THE SHOP, NOT THE PAGE.
//
// ── ⚠️⚠️⚠️ THE FAULT THIS FILE STANDS AGAINST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Athi, 2026-09-13 (CAT001): *"available count says 495, not available 5 — that is for the 500 you fetched
// initially, out of 10,000 products. I guess the overall count is wrong here."*
//
// AND THE SERVER HAD ALWAYS SENT THE RIGHT ANSWER. `status_counts` is computed over EVERY row — the tally query
// has no LIMIT and never had one — and rides on every response. The chips counted `UI.prods` instead, which is
// the PAGE, so they described 500 rows and presented it as the shop.
//
// ⚠️⚠️ SAME SHAPE AS "500 products but only 12 rows are listed", earlier the same day: a number that is true
// about a slice, rendered as though it were the whole. That is the failure mode of every paged screen, and it
// never looks like a bug — it looks like a smaller shop.
//
// ⚠️ AND FIXING THE COUNT ALONE WOULD HAVE MADE IT WORSE: a chip reading 112 that filters to 5 is a worse lie
// than one reading 5. So pressing it on a truncated catalogue is a SERVER query, which `?status=` has supported
// since the endpoint was paged and nothing had ever called.
//
// Run: npx playwright test tests/avail-count.spec.js --reporter=line
