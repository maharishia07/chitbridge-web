/* till-cold.cjs — THE COUNTER OPENS AND BILLS WITH NO SERVER AT ALL ([TILL-106])
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-19: *"we can see how independantly this application can run"* — and, asked what to do first:
 * *"do the cold offline harness first."*
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️⚠️ THIS IS THE TEST THAT DID NOT EXIST, AND IT IS THE ONE THE WHOLE PITCH RESTS ON. Twenty-one harnesses
 * measure the counter and every one of them serves the page from a running HTTP server. "Works offline" has
 * therefore been an ASSERTION for as long as the counter has existed: the service worker's KEEP list is
 * maintained carefully by scripts/vendor-till.cjs and nothing has ever checked that it is sufficient.
 *
 * ⭐ SO THE SERVER IS ACTUALLY STOPPED. Not throttled, not `setOffline` alone — `srv.close()`, the port dead,
 * and then a NEW page opened at the same URL. If the service worker has not really cached the shell, nothing
 * loads and this fails. That is the point: a test that leaves the server running proves nothing about a shop
 * whose line is down.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT "COLD" MEANS HERE: a new document, not a reload of a page already in memory. Same browser context, so
 * the cache and IndexedDB survive exactly as they would on a shop PC reopened the next morning — which is the
 * real scenario. A fresh context would be a first-ever visit, which genuinely cannot work offline and is not
 * what anybody is claiming.
