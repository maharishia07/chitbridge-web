 *
 * ⭐ EXTRACTED ON THE SECOND CALL SITE, not the third. `detail-design.spec.js` proved the choice for one entity;
 * `detail-design-parties.spec.js` proves it for two. Two copies of "set the preference" is how two specs end up
 * disagreeing about what setting it means — and this one is fiddly enough (its own rail, a write to wait on)
 * that a drifted copy would fail slowly and look like a product bug.
 *
 * ⚠️ A DRIVER, NOT A SPEC: it says HOW the choice is operated and read back. What that proves belongs to whoever
 * calls it.
