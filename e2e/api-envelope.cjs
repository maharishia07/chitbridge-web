/**
 * api-envelope.cjs — A ROUTE MUST NOT ANSWER WITH A FIELD THE CLIENT ENVELOPE THROWS AWAY.
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS: THE SAME BUG, FIVE TIMES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `core.js` collapses a compound response to its array when the array's key is one of a known list — so
 * `{items:[…], total, truncated}` becomes the items array with a few siblings re-attached. The siblings it
 * re-attaches are a NAMED ALLOW-LIST (`SIBS`). Everything else is dropped, silently, with no error anywhere.
 *
 * It has now eaten five fields, and each one looked like a different bug:
 *   · `truncated`        → the catalogue search never asked the server and answered "no such product" about
 *                          96 products that exist. Athi found it.
 *   · `status_counts`    → the availability chips counted the 500 loaded rows and reported "495 / 5" for a
 *                          shop of 10,441. Athi found that one too.
 *   · `counts` / `open`  → the incident and requirement boards lost their filter chips.
 *   · `category_counts`  → the Categories screen read undefined and fell back to counting one page:
 *     and `uncategorised`  "Biscuits 19" for a shop holding 400 (2026-09-16).
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE FAILURE IS ALWAYS SILENT AND ALWAYS FLATTERING. The value reads `undefined`, the screen shows a
 * smaller, tidier number, and nothing says a field was dropped. The server is right and the screen is wrong,
 * which is the hardest direction to debug because the API answers correctly when you test it by hand.
 *
 * ⚠️ core.js has carried a warning in CAPITALS about this since the second instance — "IF YOU ADD AN ENDPOINT
 * THAT RETURNS AN ARRAY BESIDE ANY OTHER KEY, IT BELONGS ON THIS LINE" — and the fifth instance happened on a
 * day that comment was read twice. A WARNING IS NOT A GUARD. This is the guard.
 *
 * Run: node e2e/api-envelope.cjs

/**
 * ── ⚠️ THE BASELINE, AND WHY IT IS NOT AN EXCUSE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Responses that answer with a sibling this envelope drops. Each is a LATENT instance: the field is sent and
 * thrown away, and it becomes a live bug the moment a screen reads it — which is exactly how all seven confirmed
 * ones happened. They are listed rather than fixed blind, because "stop sending it" and "carry it" are different
 * answers and only somebody who knows what reads it can choose.
 *
 * ⭐ THE POINT OF THE LIST IS THAT IT SHRINKS, AND IT HAS: ten → five on 2026-09-16, by tracing every one to its
 * readers rather than guessing.
 *   · `migrated` was NOT latent at all — it was live. `messages` is a collapse key, so the product-enquiry
 *     thread read `r.messages` off the array itself and rendered EMPTY every time, which reads as "nobody has
 *     asked": the most flattering possible wrong answer. Carried now, and the call site fixed.
 *   · `supplier` and `groups` ARE read — but only because supCatalogueFull() bypasses api() to keep them.
 *     Carried, so that bypass can eventually be retired.
 *   · `view`, `pagination` and `history` had no reader anywhere: a query param echoed back, three numbers
 *     spelled a second time, and a branch label. Those routes stopped sending them.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IS LEFT IS LEFT ON PURPOSE, not unexamined:
 *   · relationships.js `schema, fields, finishes` — no reader on this payload, but these two are the
 *     not-found and unavailable FALLBACKS of a route whose success path builds the same keys from
 *     buildPublicView(). Making a fallback a different shape from the success it stands in for is a worse
 *     fault than an unread field.
 *   · products.js — `prodAddMany` has no call site in the web app at all; the only caller is the Node
 *     connector, which does not pass through core.js and discards the response. Deleting the dead endpoint
 *     entry is the real fix and it is a decision, not a tidy-up.
 *   · till.js — that route never goes through core.js (the counter fetches it raw), so it is not a SIBS
 *     hazard at all. It stays listed only so the guard's arithmetic stays honest.
 *   · actors.js `summary` — no reader; a genuine candidate to stop sending, left for a day when the
 *     workforce screens are being touched anyway.
 *
 * ⚠️ Keyed by file + the dropped names, NOT by line number — a baseline that moves when somebody adds a blank
 * line above it is a baseline that gets deleted in frustration.
