// ⚠️ IT DRIVES THE SCREEN, NOT THE API. tests/local-supplier.test.js already covers the handle grammar, the
// numbering and the refusals. What is untested until something clicks the buttons is whether a person can reach
// any of it — whether the tabs paint, whether a plain name is accepted where it was refused for months, and
// whether the row that cannot be ordered from says so instead of offering a button that dies.
