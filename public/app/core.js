 * the SQL and saved nothing: the query was never the problem, the number of journeys was.

 * for one kind and still get one kind back, the per-kind cache is still the per-kind cache, and a caller that
 * asks later still gets its own request. The batching lives entirely in here.
 *
 * ⚠️ A MICROTASK, NOT A TIMER. `Promise.resolve().then()` fires after the current synchronous run and before
 * the browser paints, so a screen whose render path asks for five kinds in a row gets all five in one call
 * with no delay a person could perceive. A setTimeout would add latency to the very thing being sped up.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND A KIND WITH NOTHING ON THE SHELF MUST BE CACHED AS EMPTY. The response only contains rows for kinds

 * come up, none of them knows about the others, and none of them should have to.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ SO THE DEDUPE BELONGS HERE, NOT IN THE CALLERS. Every fix in the callers is a fix for one pair of them;
 * this one is a fix for every pair that will ever exist, including the ones added next year. `defList` needed
 * a batcher because its callers ask DIFFERENT questions; `prodList` needs only this, because they ask the
 * same one.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ IN FLIGHT ONLY — THIS IS NOT A CACHE. The entry is dropped the moment the answer lands, so the next
 * caller asks the server again and gets today’s truth. A response cache here would silently change what
 * every screen in the product means by "read", and staleness bugs of that kind are unfindable.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ READS ONLY. Two POSTs are two intentions even when they look alike — collapsing them would lose a
 * write. Mutations keep the double-fire lock below, which REFUSES the second rather than joining it.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ AND EVERY JOINER GETS ITS OWN COPY. Today two calls return two separate object graphs, and callers do
 * things like `UI.prods = r.products` and then edit rows in place. Handing them one shared object would be a
 * new class of bug — one screen’s edit appearing in another — that only shows up when two screens happen to
 * load together, which is the hardest kind to reproduce. A clone costs microseconds against a 600 ms trip.
