/**
 * e2e/tooltip-length.cjs — a tooltip is a label, not a paragraph.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-22: *"the messages you are showing are going away from the screen… I am talking about the
 * fingertip message, many of them are overflowing, you may have to correct all."*
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ AND THE WORST ONE WAS WRITTEN AN HOUR EARLIER, BY ME. Turning Metrics / Group sum / Rules into icons
 * meant the `title` became the only place the name survived — and I used that as licence to move the whole
 * explanation into it. 187 characters, two sentences, hovering over a 30px button.
 *
 * ⭐ THE RULE IS ABOUT WHERE EXPLANATION LIVES, NOT ABOUT CHARACTERS. A tooltip is read in a hover, cannot be
 * scrolled, cannot be selected, is not readable at all on a touch screen, and covers whatever is under it.
 * Anything a person needs in order to ACT belongs on the screen where they can keep it. The Group sum caveat
 * about counting every status went into the PANE for exactly this reason, and the tooltip kept the name.
 *
 * ⚠️ MEASURE THE LONGEST RENDERED BRANCH, NOT THE SOURCE. Half of these are templates —
 * `'+(verified?'…':'…')+'` — whose source is long while every branch renders short. A checker that measures
 * the literal would flag correct code and be relaxed until it measured nothing, which is how a guard dies.

   * it is the same bug with a longer fuse, and it failed in the SAFE direction, which is how it would have
