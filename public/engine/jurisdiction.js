 * lib/jurisdiction.js — WHERE A PARTY IS, AND WHAT THAT DECIDES. Pure: no database, no network, no state.
 *   (classic script shape — written so it CAN be vendored to the browser, like the other engines)
 *
 * ⭐⭐ IT IS VENDORED NOW ([TILL-105], 2026-09-19) as /engine/jurisdiction.js — the wiring this header called a
 * backlog item for eight days. What follows is kept because it is the reason it matters.
 * ⚠️⚠️ IT WAS NOT VENDORED, AND AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS LINE CLAIMED IT WAS. `public/engine/` holds twelve engines —
 * money, nums, docnumber, tax, offers, rewards, locale, lots, gs1, pricing, search, qr — and jurisdiction is
 * not among them. So the counter cannot decide, offline, which payment schemes a shop's COUNTRY allows; it is
 * a server answer only.
 *
 * ⭐ The shape is right and the wiring is missing, which is a backlog item rather than a defect. What was a
 * defect is the sentence: a header claiming a file exists sends somebody looking for it, and a claim in a
 * comment is believed exactly as much as a claim in code. Found 2026-09-11 while writing this file's tests.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-10: *"can we convert the country, currency, ie the localisation as a capability so it can be used in
 * any product?"*
 *
 * ── ⭐⭐ WHAT THIS OWNS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It owns the PURE country-shaped answers — the ones that are the same for everybody and need nothing looked up:
 *   · which country a party is in, derived from what is known about them
 *   · what a shop in that country can be PAID by, as (scheme, value) pairs
 *   · which of those schemes we can honestly encode, and which we can only record
 *
 * It does NOT own three things, on purpose:
 *   1. THE GOVERNED FACTS PER REGION — currency, units, language, jurisdiction — which live in the `region_layer`
 *      TABLE and are read by lib/regional.js. Those are policy a platform operator can change; a table in code
 *      would be a second opinion that drifts from the one the platform actually enforces.
 *   2. FORMATTING — how a figure or a date is rendered. That is CBLocale (app/locale.js), which is ECMA-402 and
 *      CLDR, and knows far more about 200 locales than any list we would keep.
 *   3. TRANSLATION — which language a string is shown in. Region BOUNDS the languages offered (RFC 4647), but the
 *      choice is the reader's, and the strings are a catalogue, not a country fact.
 *
 * ⚠️ SO THE CAPABILITY IS THREE PARTS, NOT ONE FILE: this pure core · `region_layer` for what an operator governs ·
 * CBLocale for how it is rendered. Collapsing them would make the pure part un-shippable, because the moment it
 * needs a database it stops being usable in a product that has not got ours.
