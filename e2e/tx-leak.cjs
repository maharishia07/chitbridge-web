/**
 * e2e/tx-leak.cjs — SOURCE CODE MUST NOT LEAK ONTO A SCREEN.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE FAULT THIS EXISTS FOR, found 2026-09-11 by a tester agent reading the live app:
 *
 * The theme picker showed, under every colour swatch, the literal characters
 *
 *     ' + tx('Aa') + '
 *
 * where a sample "Aa" should have been. Settings → Standards showed `' + tx('Accept-Language') + '` and
 * `' + tx('Intl') + '` the same way. Three screens, printing their own source at the reader.
 *
 * ── ⭐ WHY IT HAPPENED, AND WHY IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN WITHOUT THIS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The string layer wraps every user-visible label in `tx(...)` so it can be translated. Inside a SINGLE-quoted
 * string, `'...' + tx('Aa') + '...'` is correct concatenation and there are 890 of them in this codebase, all
 * fine. Inside a DOUBLE-quoted string it is not concatenation at all — it is four literal characters, a call
 * that never runs, and four more literal characters, printed verbatim.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE TWO FORMS ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE TO THE EYE, which is exactly why a person wrapping four hundred
 * labels by hand gets a few wrong, and why grepping for `' + tx(` finds 890 hits of which three are bugs. This
 * walks the quoting instead of pattern-matching it.
 *
 * ⭐ IT IS NOT ABOUT tx(). Any concatenation marooned inside the wrong quote prints itself; tx() is simply the
 * one that happened, because it was applied mechanically across the whole codebase in one pass.
 *
 * Run: node e2e/tx-leak.cjs   · no network, no browser.

       *
       * ⚠️ BUT IT CANNOT BE CHECKED LINE BY LINE. Template literals span lines, so a scan starting mid-template
       * sees an HTML attribute's `"` as opening a string and reports every `class="${…}"` in the codebase. The
       * attempt produced EIGHTEEN false positives against one true one. ⭐ A narrow guard that is trusted beats
       * a broad one that gets switched off — so this half needs a real parse, and until then it is a known,
       * written-down blind spot rather than a silent one.
