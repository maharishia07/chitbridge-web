 *
 * Athi: "our labs should not use a separate piece of code". combo-lab.html was a 3,100-line COPY of offer-lab-next.html
 * (an older one, kept inert under a permanently open modal — its own words) plus this block. The copy is gone: the Offer
 * Lab loads this file, and offer-lab-next.html?mode=combo boots straight into the builder below (combo-lab.html now only
 * forwards there, so every old link — the till's hub, Catalogue setup, the other labs — still lands here).
 *
 * ⭐ MOVED AS IT WAS, function for function, from combo-lab.html — nothing here is new behaviour. It reads the Offer Lab's
 * own state and helpers (S · P · byId · esc · M0 · apiFetch · setCost · openPickOverlay · labUseMine …) and CBVariant,
 * exactly as it did when it sat in the same script. Styles: lab/combo-mode.css. Markup: #modLabOverlay and
 * #comboTillPreviewOverlay in offer-lab-next.html.
 * Flow: catalogue · Definitions shelf — combo / modifier templates (07-offers-pricing-and-combos, Combo Lab).

 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY ACTION HERE EDITS A LOCAL DRAFT ONLY (held right on the in-memory product, p.modifiers) — unlike
 * app.html's Modifiers tab, which saves each action at once because it IS the authoritative place to edit a

 * books "Apply" still works, just locally — there is nothing real to write to.
 * ⚠️ THE PREVIEW IS THE SAME CAPABILITY app.html's tab USES — CBVariant.groupsOf()/toggle()/missing()/words(),

 *
 * [OFFR-03] (2026-09-25, earlier the same day) taught the per-product model with one hardcoded, read-only
 * CBVariant.exampleGroup() text box: "Extra toppings / Extra cheese +₹20", never interactive, the same for
 * every merchant. Athi, testing it: "the example shown is very pathetic... what i want is something similar
 * to the combo offer in a popup window with possibly combination, and also with save as option, if we are
 * doing save as feature then we should be having a mechanism of open the same again."
 *
 * That static box is gone. In its place:
 *   - modLabBuildFresh() opens a REAL builder — the exact group-editor and live "what a customer sees"
 *     preview the per-product screen already had, now usable BEFORE picking a product (comboGroupsEditorHTML/
 *     comboPreviewHTML below, extracted so there is one implementation, not two that can drift).
 *   - "💾 Save as…" (modLabSaveAsOpen/Confirm) — POSTs to /api/combo-templates (b266, [OFFR-06]).
 *   - "📂 My saved combos" (modLabOpenLibrary/UseTemplate/DeleteTemplate) — the "mechanism to open the same
 *     again": a named, reusable library, independent of any one product. Athi: "can we do one and we can
 *     translate later as a standalone example?" — this is that standalone record, the data-model decision
 *     BACKLOG.md had logged as deferred under [OFFR-03].
 * ⭐ Every editing verb (modLabSetGroup/AddOption/…) already reads/writes through modLabGroups()/
 *   modLabSetGroups() below — making THOSE TWO draft-aware (a product's own modifiers, or a not-yet-attached
 *   draft) is the only change the existing editing code needed; nothing else duplicated.
