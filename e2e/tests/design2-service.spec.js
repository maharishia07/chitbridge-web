/* ── DESIGN 2 · ONE SERVICE JOB, CARRIED END TO END ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-23: *"do this flow — a product item should be selected, fill data in each section you have
 * created in design 2, and see the values are populated correctly and the final cost is gathered. Create a
 * playwright script and complete the transaction, I am wasting my time here."*
 *
 * ⭐⭐ SO THIS PROVES THE ARITHMETIC, NOT THE PIXELS. A screen test that clicks every control and asserts
 * nothing about the numbers passes on a screen that adds up wrong — and the number is the entire point of a
 * service job: *"this many people worked, this many materials changed, these many hours spent, and the total
 * cost."* Every recording below is therefore made through the UI and then **read back off the screen and
 * added up independently**, so a wrong total fails here rather than in front of a customer.
 *
 * THE JOB — a car arrives with two complaints, which is a two-line chit:
 *
 *   Engine service   1 job   ₹3,500 quoted    → an oil filter fitted, 90 min of labour, then closed
 *   AC repair        1 job   ₹2,800 quoted    → a compressor gas kit fitted, then closed
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY PART IS **PICKED FROM THE CATALOGUE**, never typed. That is the whole reason the picker exists:
 * a typed part cannot be reconciled against anything, so "6 materials changed" stays a claim. The catalogue
 * price is what lands on the line, and this spec asserts it did.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND A PART IS AN `add`, A JOB DONE IS A `deliver`. Fitting a filter must NOT move the line towards
 * complete — it accrues. Closing the complaint is the delivery. The two are asserted separately below,
 * because collapsing them is the one modelling mistake that would make every service job look half-finished.
 *
 * The walk itself lives in `../flows/design2` — this file supplies the job, the module supplies the hands.
