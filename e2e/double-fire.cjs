/**
 * e2e/double-fire.cjs — a double-click on Send must create ONE chit, not two.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ FOUND BY CROSS-CHECKING TEST-CASES.md AGAINST THE SUITE, WHICH IS THE POINT OF THAT EXERCISE. `B11
 * Idempotency — double-click Send quickly → only ONE chit created (double-fire lock)` has been written down as
 * a case since 2026-07-28, the lock exists in `api()`, and **nothing tested it**. The word "double-fire"
 * appears in no spec and no guard.
 *
 * ⭐ IT IS A CORRECTNESS PROPERTY, NOT A CONVENIENCE. Two chits from one click are two obligations on a
 * counterparty, two rows in their Task list and two things to dispute — created by an impatient double-click on
 * a slow connection, which is exactly when it is most likely.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE LOCK IS KEYED ON ENDPOINT **+ PARAMS**, and that detail is the whole design: sending two DIFFERENT
 * chits in quick succession must both go through. A lock on the endpoint alone would block the second, which is
 * a worse bug than the one it prevents — silently refusing legitimate work.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND GETs ARE DELIBERATELY FREE. Reading twice costs a round trip; writing twice costs a record. A lock on
 * reads would break every screen that refreshes while a fetch is in flight.
 *
 * Runs the REAL api() from core.js against a stub transport — no browser, no server.
