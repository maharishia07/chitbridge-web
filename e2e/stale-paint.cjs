/**
 * e2e/stale-paint.cjs — a list response that arrives after you have left must not paint.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-22: *"find the race, that empty state is bad."*
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE BUG: clicking Settings › Localisation and being told **"Your bogie is empty · Compose"**. The
 * settings screen reuses `#detailpane` — `#setbody` lives inside it — so a list load still in flight from
 * app start resolved, wrote `renderDetail()` into `#detailpane`, and DELETED the element the settings pane was
 * about to be written into. `loadSettings` and `paintSettings` both open with
 * `getElementById("setbody"); if(!h)return;`, so the settings load then resolved into silence.
 *
 * ⭐ TWO FUNCTIONS FAILING SAFELY ADDED UP TO A SCREEN THAT FAILED INVISIBLY. Every individual guard was
 * present and correct: `if(dp)` checked the element existed, and it did — it just belonged to someone else.
 * `if(!h)return` declined to paint into nothing, which is right, and silent, which is how it hid for months.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT ONLY EVER HAPPENED ON THE FIRST VISIT, so every retry passed. Six consecutive scripted attempts
 * came back green because the first one had been the only cold one. A test that reproduces a race by repeating
 * an action can prove the opposite of what it looks like it proves.
 *
 * This guards the SHAPE that fixed it: `loadList` captures `UI.nav` at call time, and every paint after an
 * `await` asks whether the screen is still the one that asked.
