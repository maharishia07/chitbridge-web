//
// ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS: the feature shipped 2026-08-17 and its migration (b162) was run 2026-08-18 with ZERO test
// coverage. A capability whose whole point is "the right party receives it, and nobody else does" cannot be left
// to a manual look — that is exactly the claim that fails quietly.
//
// API-LEVEL ON PURPOSE, in the style of mode-survives-order: the question here is about DELIVERY and ISOLATION,
// not about a screen. Driving it through the UI would test the button and leave the claim unproven.

   * ⭐ THE SELLER IS A FRESH ENTITY AGAIN, and that is only possible because N5 is fixed.
   *
   * This spec originally had to borrow `alpha` — the shared shop the storefront specs use — because a brand-new
   * entity set to `catalogue_visibility:'public'` was NOT servable: its schema's visibility was a snapshot taken
   * at registration and never updated, so `buildPublicView()` refused it and the enquiry gate refused with it.
   * Borrowing alpha meant this spec added a product to a shared account on every run, which is the shared-account
   * drift already recorded in this repo — created while writing a test about isolation.
   *
   * With the fix, a fresh seller can open its own shop, so this spec now owns everything it touches and cleans up
   * after nobody. See shop-publish.spec.js, which tests that act directly.
