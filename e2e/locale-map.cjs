/**
 * e2e/locale-map.cjs — the two-way map between Settings controls and Profile rows, MEASURED.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-21: *"each one in profile needs to be mapped vice versa. Create a checklist for the profile
 * controls and what is being referred in settings, so it will be easier that we have not missed any."*
 *
 * ⭐⭐ SO IT DRIVES EACH CONTROL AND WATCHES WHAT MOVES. The guard this replaces held a hand-written table
 * saying which profile row reflected which setter — and a declared mapping is exactly as trustworthy as the
 * person who last edited it. This one sets a real value through the real locale layer, re-renders the real
 * profile, and diffs the rows. Nothing is claimed; everything is observed.
 *
 * TWO DIRECTIONS, TWO FAILURES:
 *   Settings → Profile   a control that moves NO row is invisible: changed, saved, and unconfirmable.
 *   Profile  → Settings  a row no control moves must be a BUSINESS fact (it comes from the entity record).
 *                        Anything else is an orphan — a value with no way to change it and no owner.
 *
 * ⚠️ "DEMONSTRATED" IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH ON ITS OWN, which is what this whole exercise proved. Athi held the two
 * screens side by side: Profile said COUNTRY: IN while Settings said PRESENTATION: United States, and the only
 * trace of the setting anywhere was that 12,345,678.9 grouped the American way. A sample shows a setting's
 * EFFECT and never lets a reader CHECK it. So a row moving is necessary — and the row that moves must NAME it.
