/* ── THE PRIMARY ACTION MUST BE ON THE SCREEN ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-23, with a screenshot of the IoT wizard: *"I couldn't progress after the first step."* The Next
 * button was painted, correct, and **at y=2483 in a 1408-tall viewport** — outside the world, unclickable, and
 * unscrollable because the frame is `position:fixed; overflow:hidden`.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ WHY IT ONLY HAPPENED TO HIM: the wizard positions itself by copying `#panel`'s rect —
 * *"reuses the app's own coordinates instead of guessing"*, which is a good instinct and a real trap. A rect is
 * measured in DOCUMENT space; a `position:fixed` box is placed in VIEWPORT space. They agree only while the
 * panel fits on screen. His co-assists list is long, so his panel was tall, so the box ran off the bottom. On a
 * test entity with two co-assists it fits, and everything looks fine — which is exactly why this spec stretches
 * the panel rather than trusting whatever the shared account happens to hold today.
 *
 * ⭐ THE RULE, stated so it outlives this one wizard: an overlay that cannot scroll must never be taller than
 * the viewport, and its primary action must be inside it. Every co-assist type is checked, because the four
 * share one frame and a fix applied to the instance rather than the class has a shelf life.
