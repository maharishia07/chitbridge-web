/**
 * e2e/type-scale.cjs — the app's REAL type scale, against the one the tokens declare.
 *
 * ⚠⚠⚠ M12b WAS WRITTEN AS A MECHANICAL SWEEP AND IT IS NOT ONE. The backlog said "collapse 25 distinct
 * sizes onto the existing --fs-* scale" — measured, only **9 of 1,042** raw declarations match a token
 * exactly. Swapping the other 1,033 would resize 656 of them DOWN and 377 UP, the largest by 39%. That is not
 * tokenisation, it is a visual redesign of every screen, and it is Athi's call rather than a sweep.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE REAL FINDING IS THAT THERE ARE TWO SCALES AND NEITHER KNOWS ABOUT THE OTHER:
 *     declared   11 · 12.5 · 14 · 16 · 20 · 28      (--fs-1..6, and 1,392 uses obey it)
 *     actual     11.5 · 12 · 13 · 13.5 · 15 · 17    (953 of 1,036 raw declarations)
 * They were designed independently and never reconciled. Every raw declaration is someone choosing a size by
 * eye because the token nearest to what they wanted was two steps away.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE COST IS NOT COSMETIC EITHER WAY. appearanceApply() scales the --fs-* tokens on <html>, so
 * `var(--fs-1)` grows with the reader's Small/Medium/Large/Extra-large setting and a raw `11.5px` does not.
 * 1,033 declarations ignore a reader who set Extra large — invisible until someone needs it, which is the
 * worst kind of accessibility failure.
 *
 * Read-only. Prints both options with their real numbers so the decision can be made on evidence.

 * ⚠️⚠️ READ THE SCALE, DO NOT RESTATE IT. This was `[11,12.5,14,16,20,28]` written out by hand, and the moment
 * display steps were added the guard was measuring against a scale the app no longer had — reporting 36px and
 * 46px as strays from a list that now contains them, and printing a header naming six sizes when there are
 * eight.
 *
 * ⭐ A CHECK THAT HARDCODES WHAT IT CHECKS IS A SECOND SOURCE OF TRUTH, and it drifts exactly like the legend
 * that fell one flag behind every time someone added a chip. `FS_BASE` is where appearanceApply reads the
 * scale, so it is the one that is true by construction.
