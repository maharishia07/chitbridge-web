/**
 * live-run-mint.cjs — drive the REAL UI through both consolidated mint paths (lib/mint.js).
 *
 * The chit_deliver consolidation replaced four hand-rolled copy-builders with one shape module. The proofs and the
 * characterisation tests are green, but they call the API. This drives a BROWSER: a person's clicks, through the
 * compose step-flow and through the public storefront, exercising the two paths a human actually uses.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not the human live run the review gate requires. My ceiling is boot/parse/behaviour —
 * I can prove the rows are right; I cannot tell you the screen reads correctly to someone who knows the business.
 * The gate exists because those are different questions, and this file does not discharge it. It narrows what is
 * left for Athi to eyeball, and says so at the end.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IT CHECKS IS THE CO-HELD INVARIANT, not "did a chit appear". Two copies of one chit must carry an
 * IDENTICAL header — same sender, subject, total, currency, schema — and differ only in who holds it and which way
 * it points. That is the thing lib/mint.js now owns for all four paths, and the thing that would silently rot if
 * any one of them drifted.
 *
 * RUN:  node e2e/live-run-mint.cjs
