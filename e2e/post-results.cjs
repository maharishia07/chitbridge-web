/**
 * post-results.cjs — push a Playwright run onto the test board.
 *
 *   npx playwright test
 *   node post-results.cjs <token> [--kind t1] [--layer web] [--label "nightly"]
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE POINT OF THIS FILE IS THAT IT IS SHORT. It reads `test-results/junit.xml`, which Playwright writes
 * because of one line in playwright.config.js, and posts it verbatim. There is no format of ours in between —
 * JUnit XML is the de-facto interchange, and the server parses it. If we ever move to Kiwi TCMS or TestRail, the
 * same file goes there instead and nothing has to be re-implemented.
 *
 * ⭐ WHY THE AUTOMATED RESULTS BELONG ON THE SAME BOARD AS THE MANUAL ONES. A case is often provable at two
 * levels — the offer arithmetic by a unit test AND by a person at the counter — and those are different evidence.
 * Kept apart on two boards, a green suite hides a red counter. Kept together, the case shows both.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE CASE KEY IS THE SPEC FILE (N01, 2026-10-07). The board lists every spec by its path —
 * `chitbridge-web/e2e/tests/one-board.spec.js` — and this used to post the bracket tag in each title
 * (`BOARD-01`), a key no board case carries. Every run was written and none of it showed. Now
 * `key_from: 'file'` keys each test by the file JUnit already names (classname), and the server folds a
 * file's tests into ONE result for the case: any fail fails it, the note says which. `--keys bracket` keeps
 * the old door for a report whose titles name an authored case.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING IS POSTED FROM AN ABORTED RUN. Playwright writes junit.xml even when the run was interrupted
 * (Ctrl-C, the global timeout) and the tests it never reached are simply absent — so the file reads as a
 * short green run. test-results/.last-run.json says how the run ended; anything but passed/failed is refused.
 *
 * Token: the first argument, or CB_BOARD_TOKEN, so a scripted T1 run can post without a copy-paste.
 * ⭐ For CI, mint a key with the `testing` scope (Settings → Integrations → Your keys) — it may post results and read
 * cases, nothing else — and keep it in the CB_BOARD_TOKEN secret. A person's session token works too, and expires.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ ONE POSTER, NOT THREE (2026-10-07). The API's CI posts its guards with THIS file (chitbridge-api ci.yml, which
 * checks this repo out beside it) rather than a copy of it:
 *   --keys name      the testcase name IS the board's key (`chitbridge-api/tests/x.test.cjs`) — no prefix
 *   --file <path>    absolute, or relative to this folder as before
 *   --warn           CI mode: anything that stops the post is a GitHub ::warning:: naming why (the HTTP status),
 *                    and the exit is 0 — a board that is down must never turn a green build red
