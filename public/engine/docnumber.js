 * ── lib/docnumber.js · WHAT A DOCUMENT NUMBER MAY LOOK LIKE, WHEREVER THE SHOP IS ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-11, mid-way through a fix to the counter's bill series:
 *   *"when you work on billing series for India, how that works for other country? Do we need to consider that?
 *    If so, please keep it as a backlog and create a helper function or as a capability so it is well bound."*
 *
 * ⭐⭐⭐ HE STOPPED ME BUILDING INDIA INTO THE TILL. The series I was fixing — `C1/26-27/0041` — encodes three
 * Indian assumptions and none of them announce themselves:
 *
 *     the 16-character cap      a GST rule, not a universal one
 *     the April–March year      India's financial year; most of the world uses the calendar
 *     the annual reset          India resets each FY; the EU does not require a reset at all
 *
 * Each is invisible until a shop outside India uses it, and then all three are wrong at once and nobody can say
 * why. That is the definition of drift, and the reason this is a file rather than three constants in till.html.
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️ WHAT IS VERIFIED AND WHAT IS NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every rule below carries `verified`. India is the one this codebase has been built and tested against. The
 * others are stated at the level I can stand behind — "a sequential number, unique per supplier" — and DELIBERATELY
 * carry no length cap, no charset restriction and no reset, because I do not know them and a guessed limit is
 * worse than an absent one: it would refuse a number that is perfectly legal where the shop actually is.
 *
 * ⭐ An unknown country therefore gets a PERMISSIVE rule marked unverified, and the caller is expected to say so
 * rather than to pretend. `rules('BR').verified === false` is the honest answer to "is this right for Brazil".
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS NOT TAX ADVICE. See C:\dev\CONSTRAINTS-offline.md, which carries the same caveat and the reasoning.
