// [BAR] THE FOUR THINGS YOU CAN DO IN THE SPEED TAB SIT ABOVE THE NUMBERS, AND NEVER MOVE.
//
// ── ⭐⭐⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Athi, 2026-09-13: *"Clear this screen and Clear everything have to be a chip, not visible as an action icon.
// Also, at the bottom, Write this up and Snapshot — it has to be on the top as a chip with clear instruction,
// so people know it. These options are not going to change, so let them be on the top."*
//
// ⚠️⚠️ AND HE IS RIGHT ABOUT WHERE, NOT ONLY HOW. "Write this up" sat at the FOOT of the reading — the one place
// a person never reaches until they have finished reading and decided to do nothing. The whole reason the Speed
// area exists is to turn a slow screen into a filed finding, and the control that does that was below the fold.
// A reset under the figures has the same problem in reverse: it is found after you have already believed them.
//
// ⚠️ AND THE ORDER IS PART OF THE ASSERTION. "They are not going to change, so let them be on the top" means the
// bar must not depend on what the reading says — a control that appears and disappears has to be re-learned.
