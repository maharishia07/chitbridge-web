/**
 * tax.js — the determination, not the rates.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-02: *"how the tax computation happens and how do we borrow the existing well proven modules"*,
 * and then: *"build tax.js with the two-address context and INV-01 field names."*
 *
 * ── ⭐⭐ WHAT WAS BORROWED, AND WHAT WAS DELIBERATELY NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * BORROWED — **the provider seam**. Every serious platform does the same thing and it is the right thing: define
 * an interface, ship a naive default, delegate real determination outward. Medusa's `ITaxProvider` is two methods
 * (`getIdentifier()`, `getTaxLines(itemLines, shippingLines, context)`) returning
 * `{rate, code, name, provider_id, line_item_id}`, with a built-in `system` provider as the placeholder and
 * Avalara/TaxJar behind the same seam. That shape is proven and costs nothing to adopt.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT BORROWED — **their context**. Medusa's `TaxCalculationContext` carries ONE address: the destination.
 * Indian GST needs TWO, because the comparison between the supplier's state and the PLACE OF SUPPLY is the entire
 * decision between CGST+SGST and IGST. Copying that interface as written would have built the defect in on day
 * one. So the seam is theirs and the context is ours.
 *
 * BORROWED — **the vocabulary of the GSTN e-invoice schema (INV-01)**, because the field names are the standard
 * an Indian buyer's system already speaks. `SellerDtls` · `BuyerDtls` · `ItemList` · `ValDtls` · `TranDtls`,
 * and inside them `Gstin` · `LglNm` · `Pos` · `HsnCd` · `AssAmt` · `GstRt` · `CgstAmt` · `SgstAmt` · `IgstAmt` ·
 * `TotItemVal` · `RndOffAmt` · `TotInvVal`. If our output already speaks that, "e-invoice ready" and "Tally
 * compatible" stop being claims and become a mapping.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE NAMES WERE VERIFIED, NOT REMEMBERED — and one of them was wrong. Seller and buyer carry **`State`**, not
 * `Stcd`; `Stcd` exists only in `DispDtls`/`ShipDtls`. That is exactly the kind of detail that passes review, ships,
 * and is rejected by the IRP months later.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ NOT BORROWED, AND NEVER TO BE — **rate tables**. This file ships no rates. A stale rate in our repository
 * is a compliance liability wearing the costume of a feature: it is wrong silently, it is wrong for everyone, and
 * nobody discovers it until a return is filed. A rate arrives per line — from the entity's own HSN declarations,
 * or from a provider whose business is keeping them current.
