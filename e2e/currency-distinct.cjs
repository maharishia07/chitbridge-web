/**
 * e2e/currency-distinct.cjs — two different currencies must never print as the same string.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE PLATFORM'S MONEY RULE MAKES THIS LOAD-BEARING. Amounts are never converted: "you always see the
 * currency the price was written in." If SGD 500 and USD 500 both render "$500.00", that promise is not merely
 * unhelpful — it is false, and falser than converting would be, because a converted number at least LOOKS
 * different. Two currencies wearing one glyph is an invisible ambiguity on a number people trade on.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT WAS REAL, AND THE OLD FOUR-CURRENCY ENVELOPE WAS HIDING IT. currencyDisplay:'narrowSymbol' collapses
 * USD/SGD/AUD/CAD to '$' and CNY/JPY to '¥' in every locale. INR, USD, MXN and EUR never collide, so while the
 * base constitution permitted only those four the bug could not be triggered. Widening the list to all 162 ISO
 * codes is what exposed it — a list that grows tests things that were never true, only untested.
 *
 * ⭐ SO THIS GUARD IS THE PAIR TO THAT WIDENING, not a separate idea: it fails the moment somebody "tidies"
 * money() back to the narrower symbol.
