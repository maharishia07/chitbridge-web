/**
 * intake.spec.js — THE CAPTURE CONNECTOR, end to end in a browser.
 *
 * channel → CAPTURE (raw, untrusted) → AI STRUCTURE → HUMAN CONFIRM → chit on the rail.
 *
 * The backend for this has been live for a while (routes/capture.js, lib/capture.js, migration b104 — the `capture`
 * table, per-entity, WITH RLS). What was missing was a way to reach it from inside the app. This drives the new
 * Intake screen against the REAL API: it records a message, has the real AI structure it, and confirms that the
 * proposed lines reach Compose — where a human still has to press Send.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT NEVER SENDS. Running against production, a spec that mints real chits on every run makes the data
 * untrustworthy. The confirm gate is asserted by showing Compose OPEN with the lines in it, which is exactly the
 * boundary that matters: a message is a notice, a chit is an obligation, and nothing crosses that line by itself.
 *
 *      npx playwright test intake --project=authed
