/**
 * e2e/asi-return.cjs — nothing may sit between `return` and the value it returns.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. `_locPendingBar()` — the "Not saved yet" bar on Settings › Localisation —
 * was written as:
 *
 *     return /* a three-line explanation of the colour choice … *\/
 *       '<div data-testid="loc-pending" …'
 *
 * A block comment containing a newline counts as a LINE TERMINATOR, so AUTOMATIC SEMICOLON INSERTION rewrote
 * the statement as a bare `return;`. The function returned `undefined`, every line of the bar below it became
 * unreachable, and `_locPendingBar() + _localeSettingsBody()` rendered the literal word **"undefined"** at the
 * top of the pane.
 *
 * ⭐ NOTHING THREW AND NOTHING LOGGED. The code parses, lints clean, and reads correctly to a human — the
 * comment is exactly where a careful author would put it. Only the runtime disagrees.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ AND IT PICKED THE WORST POSSIBLE FUNCTION. The bar is the confirmation that a change is HELD AND NOT
 * YET SAVED. Staging still worked, so the change was real; the only thing missing was the part that said so.
 * You would change a setting, see no confirmation, and reasonably conclude it had already saved.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE PLAIN FORM IS THE SAME BUG — `return` then a newline then a value — and is the one every style guide
 * warns about. This checks both, because the comment form is the one that survives review.
