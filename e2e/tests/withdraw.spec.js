/**
 * withdraw.spec.js — THE WHOLE LOOP: A withdraws, B is told, and B's copy does not move.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-02: *"wire the button and rename it to Withdraw"* · *"it has to be flagged against the order
 * right away, so we need a flag to show cancel requested"* · *"set it up on test entities and run the full loop"*.
 *
 * ── ⚠️⚠️ WHY A TWO-PARTY SPEC AND NOT THREE UNIT CHECKS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every piece of this was verified alone and every piece passed: the button's folder gate in the browser, the
 * banner's four render states against fixtures, the column arriving in the payload. What NONE of them could see
 * is the join — that the thing A presses stamps the row B reads. This session has already produced two features
 * that were green in parts and dead in the middle (a storefront gate on the wrong predicate, cancel columns added
 * to one of three list queries), so the join is the assertion worth having.
 *
 * ── ⭐ THE INVARIANT THIS EXISTS TO PROTECT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A withdrawal must NEVER move B's status. The route is emphatic — a supplier who cut the stock at 6am has to be
 * able to refuse — and that is precisely the kind of rule a later "tidy-up" breaks, because propagating the
 * status looks tidier and passes every test that only checks A's side. So B's status is read BEFORE and AFTER
 * and compared. That single assertion is the reason this file will still be worth running in a year.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT SENDS A REAL CHIT between two freshly minted test entities, which is why it is not in the default run. Athi approved
 * exactly this on 2026-09-02 ("just t1, t2 level, possibly you can use the existing test entity"). It never
 * touches a customer entity and never leaves an obligation on one.
 *
 * Run: npx playwright test tests/withdraw.spec.js --project=authed

     * ⚠️ MINTED, NOT POOLED — and the first run proved why. Athi suggested the existing test entities, so this
     * started on poolContext(0)/(1) and failed at the very first click: nav-compose never appeared, because
     * the saved pool sessions are not signed in on this machine. poolContext swallows that (its waitFor has a
     * .catch) and hands back a page sitting on the login screen, so the failure surfaces four lines later as a
     * timeout on an unrelated locator.
     *
     * mintInContext is what MP-01 uses and it works. The cost is two registrations per run; the benefit is that
     * the spec depends on nothing that a previous run has to have left behind.
