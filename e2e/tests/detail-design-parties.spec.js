/* ── EACH PARTY READS THEIR OWN COPY THEIR OWN WAY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-24: *"the customer copy and supplier copy should be the same, but the interpretation can be in
 * another tab — how the customer request is interpreted can stay within the receiving end. That is what we are
 * doing in the WhatsApp case: we store the customer request but interpret the same according to job item."*
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE COMPLICATION STEP 3 WAS LOOKING FOR, and it was already in the code. Both `chit_header` inserts wrote
 * the SAME summary_json, so a recipient's copy carried the SENDER's detail_design stamp. A fleet customer set to
 * Order level would have decided that their workshop reads jobs at order level too — the customer choosing how
 * the supplier organises their mechanics. The record is shared; the reading of it is not.
 *
 * ⚠️ TWO CONTEXTS, NOT TWO TABS. Each party is a separate signed-in browser context, so each `storedDesign` call
 * reads that party's OWN chit_header row under their own RLS. Reading both copies from one session would either
 * breach isolation or quietly read the same row twice and pass for the wrong reason.
