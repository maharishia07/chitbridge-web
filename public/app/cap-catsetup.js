/**
 * app/cap-catsetup.js — CATALOGUE SETUP: how the catalogue is SHAPED (lazy; ensureCap('catsetup')).
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-16: *"i think we are clubbing product management and catalogue management in one roof, so it is
 * confusing… another tab called catalogue mgmt … so it is a clear segregation."* He was right, and the standard
 * agrees with him.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE STANDARD SEPARATES (Akeneo / PIM, the exemplar this catalogue already adopted) ────────────────────
 * A PIM keeps four jobs apart, and we had merged all four into one toolbar:
 *   · PRODUCTS      — the records you edit daily                       → stays on Catalogue
 *   · CATEGORIES    — classification. MANY per product                 → its own screen (cap-categories)
 *   · FAMILIES /
 *     ATTRIBUTES    — the template describing a product. ZERO OR ONE   → here, as "Columns"
 *   · PRODUCT MODEL — variant axes, common vs variant attributes       → here, as "Variants"
 *   · IMPORT/EXPORT — job profiles, not toolbar buttons                → here
 *
 * ⭐ THE DISTINCTION THAT MATTERS: **categories classify, families describe.** Many categories per product, one
 * family. Treating them as one undifferentiated notion of "catalogue structure" is exactly what made the screen
 * confusing — and it is why Categories is a sibling of Catalogue rather than a section of this screen.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS SCREEN OWNS NO LOGIC. Every action here already existed on the Catalogue toolbar and is called
 * unchanged (declareVariants · startFromStandardSet · checkCatalogueFile · downloadCatalogueTemplate ·
 * exportCatalogueCSV · the face wizard). Moving a control must not become rewriting it — the point of the change
 * is WHERE things live, and a re-implementation would smuggle behaviour changes in under a re-organisation.

 * the one question a reader arrives with, *what does my catalogue record today*, had no answer on the screen
 * whose title is exactly that.
 *
 * ⭐ REMOVABILITY IS THE SERVER'S ANSWER, NOT THIS SCREEN'S. Each row carries `removable` and `locked_because`
 * computed by `lib/column-rules.js`, and the DELETE enforces the same function. A screen that decided for itself
 * would eventually enable a control the server refuses, which is worse than not offering it.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE REASON IS ON THE ROW, not behind a failed press. "12 products record a value in Grade" is what
 * tells someone what to do next; discovering it only by pressing Remove and being refused teaches the same fact
 * at a worse moment.

 * the catalogue and then unit of measure and field datatype, can you bring it in 3 different tabs, each one for
 * one purpose, so it is easier to distinguish and need to establish relationship."*
 *
 *   Columns — what does a product record, in what order        (name · order · lock)
 *   Types   — what kind of value, in what unit                  (datatype · unit · required)
 *   Usage   — who depends on it                                 (products · template · ERP map · remove)
 *
 * ⚠️ THE UNIT USED TO LIVE INSIDE THE LABEL — "Coverage (sq ft/L)" — because schema_fields had nowhere else to
 * put it, so a counterparty importing that sheet got a number with a unit only a person could read. `unit` is now
 * its own attribute, a UN/ECE Recommendation 20 code (the list GS1, Peppol and INV-01 use), behind migration b200.
 * Until b200 has run the Types tab says so rather than pretending.
 *
 * ⚠️ TIGHTENS PER COLUMN, LIKE REMOVAL. Label and unit are always free (they change no stored value); the TYPE is
 * fixed the moment a product records a value, and the control says why. Same rule, same source (column-rules).

 *
 * ⚠️ IT COULD NOT SIMPLY BE DELETED. This section used to be a paragraph and a button that opened the six-step
 * wizard — so the hub owned nine of its ten sections and handed the tenth back to the screen it replaced. Deleting
 * the wizard first would have left storefront setup with no editor at all, which is not a migration, it is a
 * removal. The controls had to exist here before the other screen could go.
 *
 * ⭐ EVERY OPTION IS READ FROM THE REGISTRY THE CODE ALREADY PUBLISHES — CBCatalogue.METHODS · UNITS · FACETS.
 * Re-listing them here is how two lists of "the methods we support" drift apart, and this screen has already made
 * that argument twice (offers.js KINDS, cart-ui MODELS).
