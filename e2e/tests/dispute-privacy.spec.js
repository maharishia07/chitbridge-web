// dispute-privacy.spec.js — THE USP, PROVEN: A disputes with B only, and C never learns of it.
//
// ⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS: this claim was carried by TWO skipped tests — multiparty.spec's [MP-02], whose own title
// ends "(the USP)", and disputes.spec's [DISP-02]. Both were `test.skip`, so the product's stated differentiator
// had no proof behind it at all, while reading as covered in every run summary.
//
// A dispute is confidential to its roster. On a chit A sent to BOTH B and C, a dispute A raises against B must
// be invisible to C — not merely unshown, but absent from C's copy. That is a per-party confidentiality claim,
// which means it has to be asked of the API as C, not looked at on a screen.
