/**
 * tax-slab.js — a named tax slab, cited by a product, inherited when it is not.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-09-03: *"in india tax is not simple, each product has different tax criteria, so it has to be
 * product specific, but there are slabs, so define slab and attach the slab to the product, check how other
 * products are doing"*.
 *
 * ── ⭐⭐ WHAT THE OTHER PRODUCTS DO, AND WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM THEM ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Tally, Zoho Books and Odoo all land on the SAME shape, independently, which is the strongest evidence a shape
 * is right: **a named tax rate is its own record, a product points at it, and an unset product inherits.**
 *
 *   Tally      "GST Rate Details" set at Stock Item · Stock Group · Company — the item's own answer wins, else
 *              the group's, else the company's. That THREE-LEVEL fallback is the part copied here verbatim.
 *   Zoho       a "Tax" record (name + rate), selected on an item; unset items fall to the org default.
 *   Odoo       `account.tax` records, defaulted per product category (`property_account_..._categ_id`).
 *
 * ⚠️ NOT COPIED — their tax ENGINE. Odoo's `account.tax` carries computation modes, sequences and repartition
 * lines because it also POSTS the entries. We do not post; `tax.js` determines and stops. Importing their engine
 * would be importing an accounting ledger we do not have.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ AND STILL NO RATE TABLE. `tax.js` says it plainly and it holds here: this file ships **no** rates. The
 * merchant authors the slabs — "GST 5%", "GST 18%" — as `definition` rows they own, version and freeze. A rate
 * hard-coded in our repository would be wrong silently, wrong for everyone, and discovered at filing time.
 * `GST_SLAB_RATES` below is a list of the rates the SCHEME defines, offered as a picker; it is not a mapping from
 * any product to any rate, and nothing here resolves one.
 *
 * ── ⭐ THE SHAPE IS defaults.js's, DELIBERATELY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `defaults.js` already says "the catalogue declares it, a row overrides it, and we know which answered", and
 * returns `{ value, from }` for exactly that reason. This is the same rule with one extra rung in the middle (the
 * category), so it returns the same kind of answer — a value AND the source that produced it — using the same
 * vocabulary. It is deliberately NOT registered in `DEFAULTABLE`: that registry decides which keys earn a
 * SPREADSHEET COLUMN, and a slab must never be one (see the SYSTEM field note in column-rules.js).
 *
 * ── ZERO DEPENDENCIES · TIER A ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
