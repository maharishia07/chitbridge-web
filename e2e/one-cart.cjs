 * Athi, 2026-09-05: "either storefront or supplier or through API, all should have the same principle … single source of
 * truth … keep it as a practice". The storefront had its own basket math for two days and drifted (no GST on the Suppliers
 * screen, a badge no screen could show). This guard fails the moment a second implementation appears:
 *   – only app/cart.js (the CART capability) may build the "Total incl. tax" row or a per-rate tax table (`byRate`);
 *   – only app/cart.js and app/offers.js may call CBOffers.evaluate for a BASKET (the product page's single-line preview
 *     and the offer form's test panel are allowed: they preview one product, they never total a basket).
