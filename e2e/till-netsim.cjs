/* till-netsim.cjs — A LINE YOU CAN TURN DOWN ([TILL-116])
 *
 * Athi: *"give an icon to set-up network capability like switch off network reduce the speed to 2g and so on,
 * so we can see how it works… you will be able to simulate the combinations, can you?"*
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE SIMULATOR IS ONLY WORTH HAVING IF IT IS FAITHFUL. The counter asks `navigator.onLine` in 34 places —
 * whether to queue a bill, whether to offer Send now, whether to try at all. A simulator that only slowed
 * fetch would leave all 34 believing the line was fine and produce behaviour no real outage causes, so the
 * assertions below are mostly about that: does the page BELIEVE it.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️⚠️ AND A COUNTER LEFT IN "off" MUST NOT LOOK BROKEN. It persists across a reload on purpose — testing
 * whether an offline bill survives a restart is the point — so the banner is the thing that stops somebody
 * debugging a counter that was never faulty.
