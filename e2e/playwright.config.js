   * `fullyParallel:false` only serialises tests WITHIN a file; separate FILES still ran across two workers. Every
   * `authed` spec signs in from ONE shared session (auth.setup.js → .auth/user.json), so those parallel files are
   * not different tenants — they are the SAME entity, and they assert on relative counts inside it
   * (`const before = …count(); expect(…).toHaveCount(before + 1)`). One file adding an intake row while another
   * is counting is a guaranteed, timing-dependent failure.
   *
   * ⚠️ IT IS NOT AN ISOLATION PROBLEM AND MUST NOT BE READ AS ONE. Cross-entity isolation is proven separately and
   * hard: prove-channels 17/17 ("A did NOT receive B's — one webhook, many entities, no leakage"), and variants
   * runs Alpha against Beta's catalogue. The bug was two tests wearing the same account.
   *
   * On 2026-08-10 this produced three red specs that every one of them passed alone — the most expensive kind of
   * failure, because it reads as a regression in whatever was last changed.
