 * ══ ⭐ THE INSTANCE — batch, expiry, serial ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-13: *"what about batch number, exp date — where does it count? Also the same product price
 * movement, how do we manage two or three of the same SKU?"*
 *
 * ── ⚠️ THE DISTINCTION GS1 ALREADY MAKES, AND WE DID NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A GTIN identifies a product CLASS. A batch or a serial identifies an INSTANCE of it. One barcode carries both:
 *
 *   (01) GTIN            which product this is          — the class
 *   (10) BATCH/LOT       which consignment              — the instance   X..20
 *   (17) USE BY/EXPIRY   when this consignment dies     — the instance   YYMMDD
 *   (21) SERIAL          which individual unit          — the instance   X..20
 *   (11) PROD DATE       when it was made               — the instance   YYMMDD
 *
 * "Two or three of the same SKU" is therefore not two or three products. It is ONE product with three lots, and
 * the thing that tells them apart is (10), not a second catalogue row.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ WHY THIS DOES NOT LIVE ON THE CATALOGUE ITEM ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It very nearly did: `starter-fields.js` put `batch_no` and `expiry` on the pharma ITEM, and the CSV importer
 * lets `batch_no` be the identity key. Follow that through and every new lot becomes a NEW CATALOGUE ITEM —
 * a thousand lots a year is a thousand products a year, each with its own version history. The catalogue quietly
 * becomes a lot ledger, which is precisely the unbounded growth b146 exists to prevent.
 *
 * Odoo gets this right and is worth copying exactly: a lot is NOT a product. It is a separate record linked to
 * one product, and the product merely declares whether it is lot-tracked at all.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ AND IT DOES NOT LIVE IN A STOCK LEDGER EITHER, BECAUSE WE DO NOT OWN THE WAREHOUSE ───────────────────────
 * Odoo and SAP hold lot records with on-hand quantities because they run the building. CB transacts across a
 * boundary instead, so what we carry is the lot identity ON THE MOVEMENT — the chit line — where it is co-held
 * and verifiable by the counterparty. That is the part an ERP structurally cannot do: it only ever sees its own
 * side of the handover.
 *
 * ⚠️ STORED ISO, MAPPED TO GS1 ON THE WAY OUT. GS1 dates are YYMMDD, which is unreadable in a database, ambiguous
 * past 2049, and does not sort against anything else we hold. We store YYYY-MM-DD and convert at the barcode
 * boundary — the standard governs the wire format, not our storage.
