# Accessibility baseline (axe-core 4.12.1, WCAG 2.2 AA tags wcag2a + wcag2aa + wcag21aa + wcag22aa)

Generated 2026-11-08T16:55:31.643Z · 80 screens (addresses from docs/SCREEN-LIST.md) x Cream, Dark, High Contrast x text size m, xl = 480 runs, 829 s · 0 run(s) failed to load.
Set-up: fixture shop (Mayur Bhavan) via e2e/lib/standin.cjs; not a real database. axe finds about 57% of accessibility issues (its README): this is a floor, not a pass.
A *violation* = one rule failing on one screen in one theme+size; *nodes* = the elements it names. 9 register rows are reached by a press inside a page, so they are checked at their page only; sheets are not visited.

**Clean means painted and clean:** of 80 addresses, 45 painted at least 300 characters of text in every run; 24 of those are clean to axe. The other 35 are not counted as clean: 5 placeholder address(es) shown as visited, 1 sign-in window, 29 near-empty in the stand-in shop (under 300 characters). Their zero means nothing was there to check.

Screens that showed a sign-in window or almost no text (so a clean result means little): /signin-lab.html (sign-in shown).

## Totals by theme and text size

| Theme | Size | Runs | critical | serious | moderate | minor | incomplete (needs a person) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cream | m | 80 | 27 | 14 | 0 | 0 | 127 |
| Cream | xl | 80 | 27 | 16 | 0 | 0 | 127 |
| Dark | m | 80 | 27 | 19 | 0 | 0 | 127 |
| Dark | xl | 80 | 27 | 21 | 0 | 0 | 127 |
| High Contrast | m | 80 | 27 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 127 |
| High Contrast | xl | 80 | 27 | 14 | 0 | 0 | 127 |
| **All** | | 480 | **162** | **96** | **0** | **0** | 762 |

Elements (nodes) behind those violations: 936 critical, 944 serious, 0 moderate, 0 minor.

## What this baseline is, and is not

- It is a floor. axe-core finds about 57% of accessibility issues (its own README). Only 24 of 80 addresses are both painted (300+ characters in every run) and clean to axe; that does not make them accessible, and the other 56 are unknown rather than clean (placeholders, a sign-in window, near-empty stand-in screens). The keyboard walk, a screen reader and the manual WCAG 2.2 items (focus order, consistent help, accessible authentication) stay with a person.
- WCAG 2.2 AA is the standard checked (axe tags wcag2a, wcag2aa, wcag21aa, wcag22aa). axe's best-practice rules are NOT in these tags, which is why moderate and minor read 0: the impacts that matter here are critical and serious.
- The shop behind the screens is the walks' stand-in (a small fixture shop), not the demo month. A screen that is mostly rows in real life is checked here in its ordinary, near-empty state; a second pass on the full local stack (the demo shop) is the next widening. Colour contrast, target size and label problems that depend on real rows will be under-counted.
- Five addresses carry a placeholder in the register (counted as not painted, never as clean) (`/shop.html?s=<shop>`, `/network-shop.html?bridge=<network>`, `/store.html?net=<network>`, `/embed.html?bridge=<shop>`, `/promo.html#key=…`): they were visited with the placeholder as written, so they show their "not found" state. `/signin-lab.html` shows the sign-in window.
- 9 register rows are reached by a press inside a page, not by an address; they are checked at their page. Sheets (popups opened by a press) are not visited here: that is a gap, listed for step 2 (a sheet-opening pass through the UX-137 ids).
- Theme and text size were set as a person sets them (localStorage cb_theme, cb_fs) and confirmed on `<html data-theme>` in all 480 runs.
- Every node in this file carries a screen code: 904 of 904 listed nodes have one (the element's own UX-137 code, else the page chip's).

## Reading the numbers

- All 162 critical violations are structural and identical in every theme (27 per theme and size): a control with no accessible name or label (`label`, `select-name`, `button-name`) or misused ARIA (`aria-allowed-attr`, `aria-required-children`). These are fixes in markup, once, not per theme.
- The serious ones move with the look: colour contrast fails in 3 screens in Cream, 8 in Dark and 1 in High Contrast; target size (WCAG 2.2 criterion 2.5.8) fails on 6 screens and gets slightly worse at the xl text size. Dark is the weakest theme.
- Three screens carry most of the element count: /standards.html (aria-conditional-attr 50 and aria-allowed-attr 33 nodes), /list-lab.html (aria-conditional-attr 46) and /conversion-lab.html (color-contrast 34, label 28). Two of those are workshop/lab pages; /standards.html is customer-visible.

## Proposed gate (for Athi to decide; nothing is blocking today)

**Today:** this is a report only. `npm run a11y:axe` writes the same two files; `.github/workflows/a11y-report.yml` runs it on demand with `continue-on-error`. Nothing on a pull request waits for it.

**Proposal, in two steps:**

1. **No new critical or serious on a changed screen.** A pull request that touches a screen's files runs the check for those screens (6 runs a screen, about 10 seconds) in Cream, Dark and High Contrast at text size m, and compares with `docs/testing/A11Y-BASELINE.json`. It fails when a screen and rule pair of impact critical or serious is present that the baseline does not hold. Moderate and minor never fail. This is a ratchet like the readability one: the baseline only moves down, in the PR that fixes the pair; a pair that must stay is listed with a reason and a round, like the KNOWN list in run-shard.
2. **New screens start at zero.** A screen added after the gate starts has no baseline entry, so it must be clean of critical and serious in all three themes before it lands; this is the "accessibility is part of how we build" rule in code. A new screen's walk (cloud-build-rules 13) already checks contrast; this adds labels, names and ARIA.

**Why this threshold:** it is the smallest rule that stops the count growing without asking anyone to fix 96 serious and 162 critical in one go, it blocks only what a PR itself introduced, and it needs no judgement from a reviewer. The cost is one box run of about 14 minutes for the full set or a few minutes for changed screens; run it on the SIT box, not a laptop.

**Before the gate can start:** (a) the stand-in shop widened or the run moved to the demo shop so the baseline is not flattered; (b) the sheet pass added; (c) one owner for the fixes, starting with the five critical rule families (a handful of controls in accounts, finance, settings and the labs).

Reuse: `e2e/a11y-contrast.cjs` (themes' declared contrast claims) stays; this adds what it cannot see. `e2e/tests/axe.spec.js` (3 specs on the old workshop, via @axe-core/playwright from npm) is left alone: its pages are not in the register and it does not use the vendored copy; folding it into this module is a follow-up for the same owner.
