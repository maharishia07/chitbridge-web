/* ── A CAPTURED JOB MUST KNOW WHO ASKED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-24, after testing design 2 on WhatsApp jobs: *"data was not moving from customer to supplier."*
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ IT NEVER HAD BEEN, AND THE REASON WAS ONE EMPTY BOX. Those jobs were recorded through Intake with the
 * "from" field blank, so `sender_ref` was null → `summary_json.via.from` was null → every screen that asks *who
 * asked for this* had nobody to name. The chit read as the workshop writing to itself, the party line warned
 * there was no other party, and the whole Them side looked hollow — for want of a phone number nobody was made
 * to type.
 *
 * ⭐ A real webhook always carries the sender; the provider supplies it. So this only ever bit the hand-driven
 * path — which is exactly the path the product is tested and judged on.
