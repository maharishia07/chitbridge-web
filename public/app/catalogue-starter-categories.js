/**
 * app/catalogue-starter-categories.js — A SMALL STANDARD SET OF CATEGORIES, PER TRADE.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-16: *"seed the small standard set first… bring the proper standard here."*
 *
 * ⭐ EVERY NODE IS REAL. Names and `gid` come from the **Google Product Taxonomy** (version 2021-09-21, the
 * full 5,595-row file is kept at C:\dev\REF-google-product-taxonomy-2021-09-21.txt). Nothing here was invented,
 * and no id was guessed — an invented classification code is worse than none, because it looks citable.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE SHAPE MIRRORS lib/starter-fields.js ON THE SERVER, which already does exactly this for COLUMNS
 * (`starterFor(vertical)` · gold · coffee · pharma · paint · veg · retail · trade). Same verticals, same idea:
 * a trade's usual starting point, extended by the merchant afterwards. A second shape for the same concept is
 * how two lists of "what this trade needs" drift apart.
 *
 * ⚠️ OPT-IN, NEVER AUTOMATIC. A shelf that arrives pre-filled is worse than an empty one — Akeneo ships its demo
 * tree as an opt-in fixture for the same reason. This file is DATA; the seeding action asks first.
 *
 * ⚠️ `gid` IS THE TAXONOMY'S id, NOT OURS. It is kept so a category can later carry its standard code (and a
 * GS1 GPC brick beside it) rather than being re-matched by name. `parent` refers to a `gid` in the same set.
 *
 * ⚠️ SMALL ON PURPOSE. Full-scale seeding is blocked by UNIQUE (entity_id, kind, name) on `definition` — real
 * taxonomies repeat leaf names across branches, and lifting that needs a migration. See BACKLOG item 22.
