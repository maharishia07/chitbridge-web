/**
 * locale.js — THE LOCALISATION LAYER. One roof for every decision that changes across a border.
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-18: *"this system has to be truly language independent… we have a layer called localisation for
 * that purpose. Bring all those under that layer… bring all under one roof, so we can make it truly universal."*
 *
 * ── WHY A LAYER AND NOT A HELPER ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Localisation is not translation. Translation is one of EIGHT things that change when a reader changes, and
 * before this file each of them was decided somewhere different — or not decided at all:
 *
 *   language      the words                    was: cbLang() in localStorage
 *   direction     which way the page runs      was: nowhere; RTL was impossible until the 378-property sweep
 *   numerals      1234 vs ١٢٣٤                  was: nowhere; every locale silently got Western digits
 *   numbers       grouping and decimal mark    was: taken from the CURRENCY (see below)
 *   money         symbol, placement, grouping  was: CCY_LOCALE — currency mistaken for locale
 *   dates         order, month names, calendar was: pinned 'en-IN' in three separate functions
 *   times         12h/24h, am/pm wording       was: pinned 'en-IN' in fmtAt
 *   sort          how a list orders            was: default JS sort — wrong in every non-English script
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE BUG THIS FILE EXISTS TO FIX: CURRENCY IS NOT LOCALE. `CCY_LOCALE` mapped INR→en-IN, USD→en-US, and
 * formatted money with the locale of the MONEY rather than of the READER. Measured:
 *     every viewer of a USD price saw   $123,456.50      (US grouping)
 *     every viewer of an INR price saw  ₹1,23,456.50     (Indian lakh grouping)
 * …whoever they were. A French reader got lakh grouping; an Indian reader got US grouping. The currency decides
 * the SYMBOL. The reader decides the FORMAT. They are independent, and conflating them is wrong for everyone
 * who is not the one person the mapping happened to suit.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND TIME WAS PINNED TO en-IN FOR EVERYONE — `09:15 pm` to a reader in Tokyo (21:15) or Dubai (09:15 م).
 * That pin was deliberate, for a good reason: "so time is deterministic across browsers" in tests. Keeping the
 * test honest and the product wrong is the wrong trade; determinism belongs in the TEST, by setting a locale.
 *
 * ── THE RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ⭐ EVERY locale decision goes through here. If a screen calls `toLocaleString` directly it has made a private
 * localisation decision that nobody can see, change, or test — which is exactly the state this replaces.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE BOUNDARY THAT MATTERS MORE THAN ANY OF IT: this layer localises CHROME AND FORMAT. It never
 * touches user DATA. A product name, a chit subject, a dispute reason are the author's own words; a chit is a
 * SHARED record, and one that reads differently to each party is not a record. Formatting a number is
 * presentation. Rewriting what someone wrote is not.

  /* RTL scripts. ⚠️ Kept as a LIST rather than guessed from the language: there is no rule that derives
     direction from a language tag, and a guess that is right four times out of five is a layout that breaks for

  /**
   * ⭐⭐ PRESENTATION AND LANGUAGE ARE TWO CHOICES, AND ONE CONSTRAINS THE OTHER.
   *
   * Athi, 2026-08-18: *"under locale, we have to split presentation style and languages separately… if the
   * language and the style contradicts then it will be a problem, so we have to specify, for this style, these
   * are the languages compatible out of which you can choose say two or three max."*
   * *"example, india, left to right, english, tamil and hindi"* · *"uae, arabic, right to left, couple of
   * languages."*
   *
   * ⚠️ THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Language and format were deliberately independent — an Indian trader may want
   * English words with lakh grouping. But independent meant UNBOUNDED: nothing stopped Arabic words with Indian
   * formatting and a Buddhist calendar, a combination no reader on earth wants and no CLDR locale describes.
   * Freedom without a guardrail is not flexibility, it is a way to produce a screen nobody can read.
   *
   * ⚠️ REGION → LANGUAGES IS CURATED, AND IT HAS TO BE. ECMA-402 exposes direction (getTextInfo) and script
   * (maximize), but NOT CLDR's territoryInfo — the table of which languages are actually used in a territory.
   * That data exists in CLDR and is copied here rather than invented; when `Intl` exposes it, this table should
   * be deleted rather than maintained.
   *
   * ⚠️⚠️ AND ONE CORRECTION TO THE BRIEF, WHICH MEASUREMENT FORCED. A region cannot carry a single DIRECTION.
   * The UAE list has to include English, because UAE businesses trade in it — and English is left-to-right while
   * Arabic is right-to-left. Urdu, also used there, is right-to-left again. So direction is a property of the
   * LANGUAGE YOU ARE READING (strictly, of its script), not of the region:
   *     ar → ar-Arab-AE → rtl        ur → ur-Arab-PK → rtl        en → en-Latn-US → ltr
   * Modelling direction on the region would have made "UAE + English" render right-to-left, which is exactly the
   * contradiction this feature exists to prevent — arriving from the fix rather than the bug.

   * currency — the entire table of currency can be showcased."*
   *
   * ⚠️ THE DISTINCTION DECIDES WHETHER THIS SHORT MAP IS HONEST. A list that SUGGESTS may be incomplete
   * without harming anyone: a business in a region we have not mapped gets no suggestion and picks from the full
   * table. A list that LIMITS must be complete, or it silently forbids real trade. The four-currency envelope
   * that prompted this was the second kind wearing the first kind's clothes.
   *
   * ⚠️ AN ARRAY, NOT A SCALAR, because a region can honestly have more than one — and because a scalar
   * would have to be defended the day someone adds the second.
