/**
 * e2e/lib/today.cjs — THE ONE "TODAY" OF A WALK (round QW1-TODAY, 2026-10-14).
 *
 * CB_TODAY=YYYY-MM-DD fixes the business day every walk runs on; unset = the real day. A walk (or a stand-in under it) never says
 * `new Date()` for a business date — it asks here. lib/walk.cjs freezes the PAGE's clock to NOW when CB_TODAY is set (Playwright ctx.clock),
 * so the browser and the stand-in answer the same day. e2e/guard-walk-today.cjs fails a raw clock read in a walk.
 * Not moved: the real api (--real) — chitbridge-api lib/shop-clock.js has no env override yet, so walk.cjs leaves the page clock alone there.
