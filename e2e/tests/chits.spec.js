/**
 * ⚠️ THE LOCAL composeSelfChit IS GONE — it was a COPY of the fixture, and it drifted the moment compose became a
 * four-step wizard: the shared one was updated, this one was not, and CHIT-01 then timed out waiting for
 * chit-add-self on a step that was no longer showing. Exactly the shape this codebase keeps paying for — the walk
 * was shared and a caller kept its own copy. One walk, in fixtures.js.

/**
 * ⭐⭐ ONE WAY TO ASK "WHERE WAS THIS CHIT FILED" — used by CHIT-01 and CHIT-01b.
 *
 * ⚠️ SHARED FOR THE REASON THE NOTE ABOVE GIVES — a local copy is the recurring bug in this file. Writing this
 * inline in both tests would set the same trap for whoever next changes the response envelope.
 *
 * ⚠️ `api()` RETURNS THE ARRAY, NOT `{chits:[…]}` — it unwraps the envelope the raw route sends. Reading `.chits`
 * gets undefined and every case reports "not there", which looks exactly like the product suppressing copies it
 * is actually creating: a test that reads the wrong field fails in the shape of the bug it exists to catch.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND THE PAGE LIMIT IS THE ONE REMAINING ACCUMULATION RISK. The shared `authed` entity keeps filling, so
 * this asks for the newest 50 and relies on newest-first ordering. It is asking a LIST a targeted question,
 * which is still better than asking a SCREEN — but if these specs ever go flaky again in a long batch, this
 * limit is the first place to look, not the timeout.

   * It was red for days. The data was never missing: /api/chits/sent and /inbox both hold the chit. What the
   * spec did not know is that `self_copy_pref` DECIDES which copies a pure self-chit gets, and the unset default
   * is `received` — Task only. Order showing nothing was the governed behaviour working.
   *
   * routes/chits.js:292 says why, and the reasoning is the product's, not an implementation detail:
   *   *"The Order/Sent list is the record of obligations placed on SOMEONE ELSE, and a self-chit places none —
   *    filing it there asserts 'I sent this to a counterparty', which is false."*
   *
   * ⚠️ THE TEMPTING FIX WAS A LONGER TIMEOUT. It would have gone green by waiting for something that is never
   * coming, and buried a governance rule that nothing else tests.
   *
   * So the spec now DECLARES the setting it is testing instead of assuming a default, and covers all three —
   * each is a real, reachable behaviour and none of them had a test.
