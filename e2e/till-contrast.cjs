/**
 * till-contrast.cjs — THE COUNTER'S OWN PALETTE, MEASURED.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ WHY THIS EXISTS. `a11y-contrast.cjs` measures app.html and has done for months — 575 checks, green. The
 * counter was never in it. The till is a separate file with its OWN tokens, so the one screen that is read at
 * arm's length, in a bright shop, by somebody counting money in front of a customer, was the one screen whose
 * colours nobody had ever measured. Athi, 2026-09-16: *"pass our screen through design gateway, so the look and
 * feel should be prominent."* A look-and-feel claim that has not been measured is an opinion.
 *
 * ⭐ IT MEASURES WHAT A COUNTER ACTUALLY READS, not every token pair that exists:
 *   · the figures        --ink on --card / --paper
 *   · the quiet facts    --dim (the per-unit line, the "qty × price" column) — this is the one that slips
 *   · the discount       --ok on --card: the only green number on the row, and a number people check
 *   · the buttons        --ok and --warn as FILLS with white on them (Save & print, remove)
 *   · the edges          --line on --card (WCAG 1.4.11) — the six-column cart is made of rules now
 *   · BOTH THEMES, because a dark till is a real shop at night, not a preference.
 *
 * ⚠️ LARGE-TEXT ALLOWANCES ARE NOT TAKEN. Everything here is treated as body text at 4.5:1 even where the type
 * is big, because the operator sets the text size (Small…Very large) and a threshold that depends on a setting
 * is not a threshold. The TOTAL is large in every theme; the per-unit line under a cart row is not.
 *
 * Run: node e2e/till-contrast.cjs        (exit 1 on any failure)
