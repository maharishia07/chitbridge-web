/* app/pick.js — CBPick: open the catalogue over any screen and hand the selection back.
 *
 *
 * Athi, 2026-08-23: *"if it is a module, we should be able to call it on top of any other screen on its own and
 * pass the selection back to the calling system, can't we?"* — after the worklist's picker came up with no
 * search bar, no styling, and "your catalogue is empty" flashing before the read had finished.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ HE IS DESCRIBING THE FIX FOR THE CAUSE, NOT THE SYMPTOM. Four screens each assembled the picker by hand —
 * compose (app.html:4764), Suppliers (6729), Network (cap-network.js:1375) and the worklist. The first three
 * call `CBCatUI.pickerHTML()`, which is *"the whole picker: cart bar, search box, list, in that order"* and
 * which is also the only place `ensureCss()` runs. The worklist wired the two hosts itself and called
 * `cart.paint()` — so it got rows and nothing else: no header, therefore **no search box**, and no stylesheet,
 * therefore **no styling at all**. Exactly what he screenshotted.
 *
 * ⚠️ A FOURTH CORRECT COPY WOULD NOT HAVE FIXED IT. The next screen to want a catalogue would assemble a fifth,
 * and would get one of the four parts wrong — because "open the catalogue" is genuinely four decisions (modal,
 * loading state, renderer, commit) and nothing was holding them together. This holds them.
 *
 *     const lines = await CBPick.open({
 *       title:    'Take materials',
 *       subtitle: line.particulars,
 *       confirm:  'Add to this line',
 *       catalogue: () => ensureCatalogue().then(toPickerItems),   // or an array
 *     });
 *     if (!lines) return;            // cancelled — the caller decides what to restore
 *     record(lines);                 // [{ item_id, name, unit, price, qty }]
 *
 * ⚠️ IT RESOLVES, IT DOES NOT CALL BACK INTO THE SCREEN. The caller keeps its own control flow, which is what
 * makes this callable from a card, a modal, a line, or a screen that does not exist yet. `null` means cancelled
 * and is deliberately different from `[]` (opened, picked nothing, pressed confirm).
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT OWNS THE MODAL IT OPENS, INCLUDING PUTTING BACK WHAT IT COVERED. A picker opened from inside a card
 * replaces that card — #modalhost holds one thing — so `onClose` is where the caller repaints what was there.
