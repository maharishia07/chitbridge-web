/**
 * ep-aliases.cjs — ⭐⭐ ONE ENDPOINT, ONE NAME.
 *
 * Athi's backlog, 2026-09-04: *"EP TRIPLICATION — /api/governance/profile is registered three times (vaultGet ·
 * profileGet ×2)."*
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ WHY A SECOND NAME IS NOT HARMLESS. The endpoint map is also a REGISTER: `OUTBOX_KEYS` in core.js decides
 * which calls survive being offline, and it is keyed by NAME, not by path. So `profileSave` was queued offline and
 * `profilePut` — the same PUT to the same URL — was not. Retiring an alias therefore silently changes behaviour
 * somewhere else entirely, and adding one silently creates a call that behaves differently from its twin. Two
 * names for one endpoint is two places to keep a rule, and they only ever drift apart.
 *
 * ⚠️ A capability file re-registering a name IDENTICALLY is the same hazard one step quieter: `Object.assign(EP,…)`
 * overwrites whatever core declared, so the definition that wins is decided by load order.
 *
 * Run: node e2e/ep-aliases.cjs   (wired into `npm run check`)

   * ⚠️⚠️ THESE FOURTEEN ARE **NOT APPROVED — THEY ARE UNEXAMINED**, and the difference matters. They are written

   * deliberate pair (one route, two verbs in the UI's language, differing only by body — `assign`/`unassign`,
   * `advance`/`status` look like that) or a genuine duplicate like the governance/profile triple was.
   *
   * ⚠️ FOR WHOEVER WORKS ONE OFF: check core.js OUTBOX_KEYS first. It is keyed by NAME, so retiring a name that
   * is listed there without adding its survivor silently stops that write being queued when offline — which is
   * exactly what nearly happened retiring `profileSave`, and nothing anywhere would have said so.
